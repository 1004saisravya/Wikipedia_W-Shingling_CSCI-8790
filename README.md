The objective of this project is to investigate the evolution of Wikipedia city pages across time pressures utilizing W-shingling and λ-min sketching. For these city pages we maintain both the current version and prior versions of each page and calculate Jaccard similarity against two values of shingle window sizes, w ∈ {25, 50}, and λ-min sketching against five sketch sizes, λ ∈ {8, 16, 32, 64, ∞}. The code provides CSV based results, individual city plots, and a timing plot indicator of generally performance.
