Charlestonis themost populous cityin the U.S. state ofSouth Carolina. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina's coastline onCharleston Harbor, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of theAshley,Cooper, andWandorivers. Charleston had a population of 150,227 at the2020 census.[7]The population of theCharleston metropolitan area, comprisingBerkeley,Charleston, andDorchestercounties, has an estimated 870,000 residents.[b][8]It ranks as thethird-most populous metropolitan area in the stateand the71st-most populous in the U.S.It is thecounty seatof Charleston County.[10]
Charleston was founded by the English in 1670 as Charles Town, named in honor ofKing CharlesII. Originally established at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River (nowCharles Towne Landing), the settlement was moved in 1680 to its present location, where it quickly grew to become the fifth-largest city in North America by the 1690s. During the colonial period, Charleston remainedunincorporatedand was governed by a colonial legislature and a royal governor, with administrative districts and social services organized byAnglican parishes. Although the state capital was relocated toColumbiain 1788, Charleston remained among thetop 10 U.S. cities by populationthrough 1840.[11]A significant part of Charleston's history is its central role in the transatlantic slave trade; local merchants, includingJoseph Wragg, helped break the monopoly of theRoyal African Company, making Charleston a primary entry point for enslaved Africans. Almost one-half of enslaved people imported to the United States arrived in Charleston.[12]In 2018, the city formally apologized for its role in theAmerican slave trade.[13]
The economy of Charleston is anchored by tourism, port and logistics, aerospace, and information technology. The city is home to thePort of Charleston, one of the busiest in the United States, which significantly contributes to regional trade and economic activity.Boeingand other major employers have established a strong aerospace presence, while its growing tech industry has led to the nickname "Silicon Harbor". Culturally, Charleston is renowned for its well-preserved architecture, historic landmarks, and richGullahheritage, alongside vibrant culinary, music, and arts scenes. Popular attractions include the historicCity Market,Fort Sumter National Monument, and antebellum homes alongthe BatteryandRainbow Row.


### History


### Colonial era (1670–1776)
King Charles IIgranted the charteredProvince of Carolinato eight of his loyal friends, known as theLords Proprietors, on March 24, 1663. In 1670, GovernorWilliam Saylearranged for several shiploads of settlers fromBermudaandBarbados.[14][15]These settlers established what was then called Charles Town at Albemarle Point, on the west bank of the Ashley River, a few miles northwest of the present-day city center.[16][17]Charles Town became the first comprehensively planned town in theThirteen Colonies. Its governance, settlement, and development were to follow a visionary plan known as theGrand Modelprepared for the Lord's Proprietors byJohn Locke.[18]Because theCarolina's Fundamental Constitutionswas never ratified, however, Charles Town was never incorporated during the colonial period. Instead,local ordinanceswere passed by the provincial government, with day-to-day administration handled by thewardensandvestriesofStPhilip'sandStMichael'sAnglicanparishes.[17]
At the time ofEuropean colonization, the area was inhabited by the indigenousCusabo, on whom the settlers declared war in October 1671. The settlers initially allied with theWesto, a northern indigenous tribe that traded in enslaved Indians. The settlers abandoned their alliance with the Westo in 1679 and allied with the Cusabo instead.[19]
The initial settlement quickly dwindled and disappeared while another village—established by the settlers on Oyster Point at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers around 1672[17]—thrived. In 1680, this second settlement formally replaced the original Charles Town,[20]which today is  commemorated asCharles Towne Landing. The second location was more defensible and had access to a fine natural harbor. The new town had become the fifth largest in North America by 1690.[21]
Asmallpoxoutbreak erupted in 1698, followed by an earthquake in February 1699. The latter caused a fire that destroyed about a third of the town. During rebuilding,[22]ayellow feveroutbreak killed about 15% of the remaining inhabitants. Charles Town suffered between five and eight significantyellow feveroutbreaks over the first half of the 18th century.
It developed a reputation as one of the least healthy locations in theThirteen Coloniesfor ethnic Europeans.Malariawas endemic. Although malaria did not have such high mortality as yellow fever, it caused much illness. It was a major health problem throughout most of the city's history before dying out in the 1950s after the use of pesticides cut down on the mosquitoes that transmitted it.[23]
Charles Town was fortified according to a plan developed in 1704 underGovernorNathaniel Johnson. BothSpainandFrancecontested Britain's claims to the region. Various bands ofNative Americansand independentpiratesalso raided it.
On September 5–6, 1713 (O.S.), a violenthurricanepassed over Charles Town. TheCircular Congregational Churchmanse was damaged during the storm, and church records were lost. Much of Charles Town was flooded as "the Ashley and Cooper rivers became one." At least seventy people died in the disaster.[24][25]
From the 1670s, Charleston attracted pirates. The combination of a weak government and corruption made the city popular with pirates, who frequently visited and raided the city. Charles Town was besieged by the pirateBlackbeardfor several days in May 1718. Blackbeard released his hostages and left in exchange for a chest of medicine fromGovernor Robert Johnson.[26]
Around 1719, the town's name began to be generally written as Charlestown[17]and, excepting those fronting the Cooper River, the old walls were largely removed over the next decade. Charlestown was a center for the inland colonization ofSouth Carolina. It remained the southernmost point of theSouthern Coloniesuntil theProvince of Georgiawas established in 1732. As noted, the first settlers primarily came fromEurope,BarbadosandBermuda. The Barbadian and Bermudan immigrants were planters who brought enslaved Africans with them, having purchased them in theWest Indies.
Early immigrant groups to the city included theHuguenots,Scottish,Irish, andGermans, as well ashundreds of Jews, predominatelySephardifromLondonand significant cities of theDutch Republic, where they had been given refuge.[27]As late as 1830, Charleston's Jewish community was the most prominent and wealthiestin North America.[27][28]
By 1708, most of the colony's population wereBlackAfricans. They had been brought to Charlestown via theAtlantic slave trade, first asindentured servantsand then asenslaved people. In the early 1700s, Charleston's largest slave trader,Joseph Wragg, pioneered the settlement's involvement in the slave trade. Of the estimated 400,000 captive Africans transported to North America to be sold into slavery, 40% are thought to have landed atSullivan's Islandoff Charlestown.Free people of coloralso migrated from theWest Indies, being descendants of white planters and their Black consorts and unions among the working classes.[29]
In 1767, Gadsden's Wharf was constructed at the city port on the Cooper River; it ultimately extended 840 feet and could accommodate six ships at a time. Many enslaved people were sold from here.[30]Devoted to plantation agriculture that depended on enslaved labor, South Carolina became a slave society: it had a majority-Black population from the colonial period until after theGreat Migrationof the early 20th century, when many rural Blacks moved to northern and midwestern industrial cities to escapeJim Crow laws.
At the foundation of the town, the principal items of commerce werepinetimberandpitchforshipsandtobacco. The early economy developed around thedeerskintrade, in which colonists used alliances with theCherokeeandCreekpeoples to secure the raw material.
At the same time, Native Americans kidnapped and enslaved each other in warfare. From 1680 to 1720, approximately 40,000 native men, women, and children were sold through the port, principally to theWest Indiessuch as (Bermudaandthe Bahamas), but also to other Southern colonies.[31]The Lowcountry planters did not keep enslaved Native Americans, considering them too prone to escape or revolt. They used the proceeds of their sale to purchase enslaved Black Africans for their ownplantations.[32]The slave raiding—and the European firearms it introduced—helped destabilizeSpanish FloridaandFrench Louisianain the 1700s during theWar of the Spanish Succession.[32]But it also provoked theYamasee Warof the 1710s that nearly destroyed the colony. After that, South Carolina largely abandoned the Indian slave trade.[31]
The area's unsuitability for growingtobaccoprompted theLowcountryplantersto experiment with othercash crops. The profitability of growing rice led the planters to pay premiums for enslaved people from the "Rice Coast" who knew its cultivation; their descendants make up the ethnicGullahwho created their own culture and language in this area.[33]Slaves imported from the Caribbean showed the planter George Lucas's daughter Eliza how to raise anduseindigofordyeingin 1747.
Throughout this period, enslaved people were sold aboard the arriving ships or at ad hoc gatherings in the town's taverns.[34]Runaways and minorslave rebellionsprompted the1739 Security Act, which required all white men to carry weapons at all times (even to church on Sundays). Before it fully took effect, the Cato orStono Rebellionbroke out. The white community had recently been decimated by amalariaoutbreak, and the rebels killed about 25 white people before being stopped by the colonial militia. As a result of their fears of rebellion, whites killed a total of 35 to 50 Black people.[35][36]
The planters attributed the violence to recently imported Africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charlestown. They relied for labor upon the slave communities they already held. The1740 Negro Actalso tightened controls, requiring a ratio of one white for every ten Blacks on any plantation (which was often not achieved) and banning enslaved people from assembling, growing personal food, earning money, or learning to read.Drumswere banned because Africans used them for signaling; enslaved people were allowed to use string and other instruments.[37]When the moratorium expired and Charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750, the memory of the Stono Rebellion resulted in traders avoiding buying enslaved people from theCongoandAngola, whose populations had a reputation for independence.
By the mid-18th century, Charlestown was the hub of the Atlantic slave trade in theSouthern Colonies. Even with the decade-long moratorium, its customs processed around 40% of the enslaved Africans brought to North America between 1700 and 1775,[34]and about half up until the end of the African trade.
Theplantationsand theeconomybased on them made this the wealthiest city in theThirteen Colonies[38]and the largest in population south ofPhiladelphia. In 1770, the city had 11,000 inhabitants—half enslaved—and was the 4th-largest port in the colonies, afterBoston,New York City, and Philadelphia.
The elite began to use their wealth to encourage cultural and social development. America's first theater building was constructed in 1736; today's Dock Street Theater later replaced it.[39]StMichael's was erected in 1753.[20]Benevolent societies were formed by theHuguenots, free people of color,[c]Germans, and Jews. TheLibrary Societywas established in 1748 by well-born young men who wanted to share the financial cost of keeping up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day.[40]


### American Revolution (1776–1783)
Delegates for theContinental Congresswere elected in 1774, and South Carolina declared its independence from Britain on the steps of theExchange. Slavery was again an important factor in the city's role during theRevolutionary War. The British attacked the settlement three times,[20]assuming that the settlement had a large base ofLoyalistswho would rally to their cause once given some military support.[41]The loyalty of white Southerners towardsthe Crownhad largely been forfeited, however, by British legal cases (such as the 1772Somersett casewhich marked the prohibition of slavery inEngland and Wales, a significant milestone in theabolitioniststruggle) and military tactics (such asDunmore's Proclamationin 1775) that promised the emancipation of people enslaved by Patriot planters; these efforts did, however, unsurprisingly win the allegiance of thousands ofBlack Loyalists.
TheBattle of Sullivan's Islandsaw the British fail to capture a partially constructedpalmetto palisadefromCol. Moultrie'smilitia regimenton June 28, 1776. TheLiberty Flagused by Moultrie's men formed the basis of the laterSouth Carolina flag, and the victory's anniversary continues to be commemorated asCarolina Day.
Making the capture of Charlestown their chief priority, the British sentSir Henry Clinton, who laidsiege to Charlestonon April 1, 1780, with about 14,000 troops and 90 ships.[42]Bombardment began on March 11, 1780. The Patriots, led byBenjamin Lincoln, had about 5,500 men and inadequate fortifications to repel the forces against them. After the British cut his supply lines and lines of retreat at the battles ofMonck's CornerandLenud's Ferry, Lincoln's surrender on May 12, 1780, became the greatestAmerican defeat of the war.
The British continued to hold Charlestown for over a year followingtheir defeat at Yorktownin 1781. However, they alienated local planters by refusing to restore full civil government.Nathanael Greenehad entered the state after Cornwallis'spyrrhic victoryatGuilford Courthouseand kept the area under a kind of siege.British ArmyofficerAlexander Leslie, commanding Charlestown, requested a truce in March 1782 to purchase food for his garrison and the town's inhabitants. Greene refused and formed a brigade underMordecai Gistto counter British forays. The British finally evacuated Charlestown in December 1782. Greene presented the British leaders of the town with theMoultrie Flag.


### Antebellum era (1783–1861)
Between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, Charleston experienced an economic boom, at least for the top strata of society. Expanding cotton as a cash crop in the South led to massive wealth for a small segment of society and funded impressive architecture and culture. However, it also escalated the economic importance of enslaving people and led to greater and greater restrictions on Black Charlestonians.
By 1783, the city's growth had reached a point where a municipal government became desirable; therefore, on August 13, 1783, an act of incorporation for Charleston was ratified. The act originally specified the city's name as "Charles Ton", as opposed to the previous Charlestown, but the spelling "Charleston" quickly came to dominate.[43]
AlthoughColumbiahad replaced it as the state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous asEli Whitney's 1793 invention of thecotton ginsped the processing of the crop over 50 times.Britain'sIndustrial Revolution—initially built upon itstextile industry—took up the extra production ravenously and cotton became Charleston's major export commodity in the 19th century.
The Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building in the nation to be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. In 1800 and 1817, branches of theFirstandSecondbanks were also located in Charleston.
Throughout theAntebellum Period, Charleston continued to be the only major American city with a majority-slave population.[44][d]The city's widespread use of enslaved people as workers was a frequent subject of writers and visitors: a merchant from Liverpool noted in 1834 that "almost all the working population are Negroes, all the servants, the carmen & porters, all the people who see at the stalls in Market, and most of the Journeymen in trades".[45]American traders had beenprohibited from equippingtheAtlantic slave tradein 1794 and all importation of enslaved people was bannedin 1808, but American merchantmen frequently refused to permitBritish inspectionfor enslaved cargo, and smuggling remained common. Much more important was the domestic slave trade, which boomed as the Deep South developed into new cotton plantations. As a result of the trade, there was a forced migration of more than one million enslaved people from the Upper South to the Lower South in the antebellum years. During the early 19th century, the first dedicated slave markets were founded in Charleston, mostly near Chalmers and State streets.[34]Many domestic slavers used Charleston as a port in the coastwise trade, traveling to such ports as Mobile and New Orleans.
Enslaving was the primary marker of class, and even the town's freedmen andfree people of colortypically enslaved people if they had the wealth to do so.[46]Visitors commonly remarked on the sheer number of Blacks in Charleston and their seeming freedom of movement,[47]though in fact—mindful of theStono Rebellionand theslave revolutionthat establishedHaiti—the whites closely regulated the behavior of both enslaved and free people of color. The town fixed wages and hiring practices, sometimes required identifying badges, and sometimes censored work songs.[48]Punishment was handled out of sight by the city'sworkhouse, whose fees provided the municipal government with thousands a year.[49]In 1820, state law mandated that each act ofmanumission(freeing an enslaved person) required legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.[50]
The effects of slavery were pronounced on white society as well. The high cost of enslaving people in the 19th century and their high rate of return combined to institute an oligarchic society controlled by about ninety interrelated families, where 4% of the free population controlled half of the wealth, and the lower half of the free population—unable to compete with enslaved or rented people—held no wealth at all.[44]The white middle class was minimal: Charlestonians generally looked down upon hard work, considering it as labor meant for enslaved people.[51]All the enslavers taken together held 82% of the city's wealth and almost all non-enslavers were poor.[44]Olmstedconsidered their civic elections "entirely contests of money and personal influence" and the oligarchs dominated civic planning:[53]The lack of public parks and amenities was noted, as was the abundance of private gardens in the wealthy's walled estates.[54]
In the 1810s, the town's churches intensified their discrimination against their Black parishioners, culminating inBethel Methodist's 1817 construction of ahearsehouse over its Black burial ground. 4,376 Black Methodists joinedMorris Brownin establishingHampstead Church, theAfrican Methodist Episcopalchurch now known asMother Emanuel.[55][56]State and city laws prohibited Black literacy, limited Black worship to daylight hours, and required a majority of any church's parishioners be white. In June 1818, 140 Black church members atHampstead Churchwere arrested, and eight of its leaders were given fines and ten lashes; police raided the church again in 1820 and pressured it in 1821.[56]
In 1822, members of the church, led byDenmark Vesey, a lay preacher[56]and carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery, planned an uprising and escape toHaiti—initially forBastille Day—that failed when one enslaved person revealed the plot to his enslaver.[e]Over the next month, the city's intendant (mayor)James Hamilton Jr.organized a militia for regular patrols, initiated a secret andextrajudicialtribunal to investigate, and hanged 35 and exiled 35[56]or 37 enslaved people toSpanish Cubafor their involvement.[57]Hamilton imposed more restrictions on both free and enslaved Blacks: South Carolina required free Black sailors to be imprisoned while their ships were in Charleston Harbor, although international treaties eventually required the United States to quash the practice; free Blacks were banned from returning to the state if they left for any reason;[58]enslaved people were given a 9:15 pm curfew; the city razed Hampstead Church to the ground[57][58]and erected anew arsenal. This structure later was the basis ofthe Citadel's first campus. The AME congregation built a new church, but in 1834, the city banned it and all Black worship services followingNat Turner's Rebellionin Virginia in 1831.[59]The estimated 10% of enslaved people who came to America asMuslims[60]never had a separatemosque. Enslavers sometimes provided them with beef rations instead of pork in recognition of religious traditions.[61]
The registeredtonnageof Charleston shipping in 1829 was 12,410.[62]In 1832, South Carolina passed an ordinance ofnullification, a procedure by which a state could, in effect, repeal a federal law; it was directed against the most recenttariffacts. Soon, U.S. soldiers were dispensed to Charleston's forts, and fiveUnited States Coast Guard cutterswere detached to Charleston Harbor "to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port, and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the Customs Officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with." This federal action became known as the Charleston incident. The state's politicians worked on a compromise law in Washington to gradually reduce the tariffs.[63]
Charleston's embrace of classical architecture began after a devastating fire leveled much of the city. On April 27, 1838, Charleston suffered a catastrophic fire that burned more than 1000 buildings and caused about $3 million (equivalent to $84,910,000 in 2023) in damage at the time. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. A great cultural awakening occurred when many homes and businesses were rebuilt or repaired. Before the fire, few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued, making Charleston one of the foremost places to viewGreek Revivalarchitecture. TheGothic Revivalalso made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.[64]
By 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. Theslave tradealso depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and enslaved people bought and sold. The legal importation of enslaved Africans had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million enslaved people were transported from theUpper Southto theDeep Southin the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as theBlack Belt. Many enslaved people were transported in thecoastwise slave trade, with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.


### American Civil War (1861–1865)
Charleston was significant in theAmerican Civil War. As a pivotal city, the U.S. Army and Confederate States Army vied for control of it. The rebellion began inCharleston Harborin 1861 and ended mere months after the U.S. soldiers retook control of Charleston in 1865.
Followingthe electionofAbraham Lincoln, theSouth Carolina General Assemblyvoted on December 20, 1860, to declaresecessionfrom theUnited States, becoming the first state to do so. On December 27, the U.S. Army garrison ofCastle Pinckneysurrendered to the state militia. On January 9, 1861,Citadelcadets opened fire on the USSStar of the Westas it entered Charleston Harbor.
The first full battle of the war occurred on April 12, 1861, when shore batteries under the command of GeneralP. G. T. Beauregardfired upon theUS Army-heldFort Sumterin Charleston Harbor.[20]After a 34-hour bombardment,Major Robert Andersonsurrendered the fort.
On December 11, 1861, an enormous fire burned over 500 acres (200 ha) of the city.
U.S. Navy control of the North Atlantic coastline permitted the repeated bombardment of the city, causing vast damage.[65]Although Admiral Du Pont's naval assault on the town's forts in April 1863 failed,[20]the U.S. Navy's blockade shut down most commercial traffic. Throughout the war, someblockade runnersgot through, but not a single one made it into or out of Charleston Harbor between August 1863 and March 1864.[65]The early submarineH.L. Hunleymade a night attack on theUSSHousatonicon February 17, 1864.[66]
General Gillmore's land assault in July 1864 was unsuccessful[20]but the fall ofColumbiaand advance of GeneralWilliam T. Sherman's army through the state prompted the Confederates to evacuate the town on February 17, 1865, burning the public buildings, cotton warehouses, and other sources of supply before their departure.[20]U.S. soldiersliberated the city within the month.[20]The War Department recovered what federal property remained. Also, it confiscated the campus of theCitadel Military Academyand used it as a U.S. Army garrison for the next 17 years. The facilities were finally returned to the state and reopened as a military college in 1882 under the direction of Lawrence E. Marichak.


### Postbellum (1865–1945)
After the defeat of the Confederacy, U.S. soldiers remained in Charleston during theReconstruction era. The war had shattered the city's prosperity. Still, the African-American population surged (from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880) as freedmen moved from the countryside to the major city.[67]Blacks quickly left theSouthern Baptist Churchand resumed open meetings of theAfrican Methodist EpiscopalandAME Zionchurches. They purchased dogs, guns, liquor, and better clothes—all previously banned—and ceased yielding the sidewalks to whites.[67]Despite the efforts of the state legislature to haltmanumissions, Charleston had already had a large class of free people of color as well. At the onset of the war, the city had 3,785 free people of color, many of mixed race, making up about 18% of the city's black population and 8% of its total population. Many were educated and practiced skilled crafts;[29]they quickly became leaders of South Carolina'sRepublican Partyand its legislators. Free men of color comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876.[68][69]
ThePacific Guano Company, established in 1861, opened a plant in Charleston which consumed immense quantities ofmenhadenscrap brought from the water by the vessels which carried on their return trip a supply of South Carolina phosphates for theWoods Hole, Massachusettsfactory.[70]By the late 1870s, industry was bringing the city and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality; new jobs attracted new residents.[20]As the city's commerce improved, residents worked to restore or create community institutions. In 1865, theAvery Normal Institutewas established by theAmerican Missionary Associationas the first free secondary school for Charleston's African American population. Gen. Sherman lent his support to the conversion of the United States Arsenal into the Porter Military Academy, an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war. Porter Military Academy later joined with Gaud School and is now auniversity-preparatory school,Porter-Gaud School.
In 1875, blacks made up 57% of the city's and 73% of the county's population.[71]With leadership by members of the antebellum free black community, historian Melinda Meeks Hennessy described the community as "unique" in being able to defend themselves without provoking "massive white retaliation", as occurred in numerous other areas duringReconstruction.[71]In the 1876 election cycle, two major riots between black Republicans and white Democrats occurred in the city, in September and the day after the election in November, as well as a violent incident in Cainhoy at an October joint discussion meeting.[71]
Violent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to imposewhite supremacyin the face of social changes after the war and the granting of citizenship to freedmen by amendments to the U.S. Constitution. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by conservative Democraticparamilitarygroups, known as theRed Shirts. Violent incidents occurred in Charleston on King Street on September 6 and nearby Cainhoy on October 15 in association with political meetings before the 1876 election. The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks.[72]The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electingWade Hamptonas governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed.[71]
In the early 20th century, strong political machines emerged in the city, reflecting economic, class, racial, and ethnic tensions. The factions nearly all opposed U.S. SenatorBen Tillmanwho repeatedly attacked and ridiculed the city in the name of upstate poor farmers. Well-organized factions within the Democratic Party in Charleston gave the voters clear choices and played a large role in state politics.[73]
On August 31, 1886, Charleston experienced a strongearthquake. The shock was estimated to have amoment magnitudeof 7.0 and a maximumMercalli intensityof X (Extreme). It was felt as far away asBostonto the north,ChicagoandMilwaukeeto the northwest, as far west asNew Orleans, as far south asCuba, and as far east asBermuda. It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $6 million worth of damage ($180 million in 2023 dollars), at a time when all the city's buildings were valued around $24 million ($719 million in 2023 dollars).
The Charleston race riot of 1919 took place on the night of Saturday, May 10, between members of the US Navy and the local black population. They attacked black individuals, businesses, and homes, killing six and injuring dozens.


### Contemporary era (1945–present)
Charleston languished economically for several decades in the 20th century, though the large federal military presence in the region helped to shore up the city's economy. Charleston's tourism boom began in earnest following the publication ofAlbert SimonsandSamuel Lapham'sArchitecture of Charleston[74]in the 1920s.[75]
TheCharleston Hospital Strikeof 1969, in which mostly black workers protested discrimination and low wages, was one of the last major events of thecivil rights movement. It attractedRalph Abernathy,Coretta Scott King,Andrew Young, and other prominent figures to march with the local leader, Mary Moultrie.
Joseph P. Riley Jr.was elected mayor in the 1970s and helped advance several cultural aspects of the city.
Between 1989 and 1996, Charleston saw two significant economic hits. First, the eye of Hurricane Hugo came ashore at Charleston Harbor in 1989, and though the worst damage was in nearbyMcClellanville, three-quarters of the homes in Charleston's historic district sustained damage of varying degrees. The hurricane caused over $2.8 billion in damage. The city rebounded fairly quickly after the hurricane and has grown in population, reaching an estimated 124,593 residents in 2009.[76]Second, in 1993, theBase Realignment and Closure Commission(BRAC) directed thatNaval Base Charlestonbe closed. Pursuant to BRAC action, Naval Base Charleston was closed on April 1, 1996, although some activities remain under the cognizance ofNaval Support Activity Charleston, now part ofJoint Base Charleston.[77]
After having been a majority-minority city for most of its history, in the late 20th century, many whites began returning to the urban core of Charleston, and the area gentrified with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula's population shifted from two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010, residents numbered 20,668 whites and 10,455 blacks.[78]Many African Americans moved to the less-expensive suburbs in these decades.[78]
On June 17, 2015, 21-year-old white supremacistDylann Roofentered the historicEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Churchand sat in on part of a Bible study before shooting andkilling nine people and injuring a tenth, all African Americans.[79]Senior pastorClementa Pinckney, who also served as astate senator, was among those killed during the attack. The deceased also included congregation members Susie Jackson, 87; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Rev. Depayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; and Tywanza Sanders, 26.[80]The attack garnered national attention and sparked a debate on racism,Confederatesymbolism in Southern states, and gun violence, in part based on Roof's online postings. A memorial service on the campus of theCollege of Charlestonwas attended by PresidentBarack Obama,Michelle Obama, Vice PresidentJoe Biden,Jill Biden, and Speaker of the HouseJohn Boehner.
On June 17, 2018, the Charleston City Council apologized for its role in the slave trade and condemned its "inhumane" history. It also acknowledged wrongs committed against African Americans by slavery and Jim Crow laws.[81]

The incorporated city fit into 4–5 sq mi (10–13 km2) as late asWorld War I,[54][82]but has since greatly expanded, crossing theAshley Riverand encompassingJames Islandand some ofJohns Island. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassingDaniel Islandand theCainhoyarea. The present city has a total area of 135.51 square miles (351.0 km2), of which 115.03 square miles (297.9 km2) is land and 20.48 square miles (53.0 km2) (15.11%) is water.[5]North Charlestonblocks any expansion up the peninsula, andMount Pleasantoccupies the land directly east of the Cooper River.
Charleston Harborruns about 7 miles (11 km) southeast to the Atlantic with an average width of about 2 miles (3.2 km), surrounded on all sides except its entrance.Sullivan's Islandlies to the north of the entrance andMorris Islandto the south. The entrance itself is about 1 mi (2 km) wide; it was originally only 18 ft (5 m) deep but began to be enlarged in the 1870s.[54]The tidal rivers (Wando, Cooper,Stono, and Ashley) are evidence of asubmergentor drowned coastline. There is a submerged river delta off the mouth of the harbor, and the Cooper River is deep.


### Climate
Charleston has ahumid subtropical climate(Köppen climate classificationCfa), with mild winters, hot humid summers, and significant rainfall all year long. Summer is the wettest season; almost half of the annual rainfall occurs from June to September in the form ofthundershowers. Fall remains relatively warm through the middle of November. Winter is short and mild and is characterized by occasional rain. Measurable snow (≥0.1 in or 0.25 cm) has a median occurrence of only once per decade at the airport, but freezing rain is more common; a snowfall/freezing rain event on January 3, 2018, was the first such event in Charleston since December 26, 2010.[83]However, 6.0 in (15 cm) fell at the airport on December 23, 1989, during theDecember 1989 United States cold wave, the largest single-day fall on record, contributing to a single-storm and seasonal record of 8.0 in (20 cm) snowfall.[83]
Downtown Charleston's climate is milder than the airport's due to more substantial maritime influence. This is especially true in the winter, with the average January low in downtown being 43.6 °F (6 °C) to the airport's 38.9 °F (4 °C) for example.
The highest temperature recorded within city limits was 104 °F (40 °C) on June 2, 1985, and June 24, 1944; the lowest was 7 °F (−14 °C) onFebruary 14, 1899, although there was an unofficial record low of 1 °F (−17 °C) in February 1835.[84]At the airport, where official records are kept, the historical range is 105 °F (41 °C) on August 1, 1999, down to 6 °F (−14 °C) onJanuary 21, 1985.[83]Hurricanes are a major threat to the area during the summer and early fall, with several severe hurricanes hitting the area—most notablyHurricane Hugoon September 21, 1989 (acategory 4storm). The dewpoint from June to August ranges from 67.8 to 71.4 °F (19.9 to 21.9 °C).[85]


### Metropolitan statistical area
As defined by theOffice of Management and Budget, for use by theU.S. Census Bureauand other U.S. Government agencies for statistical purposes only, Charleston is included within theCharleston-North Charleston, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of three counties:Charleston,Berkeley, andDorchester. The metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 849,417 in 2023.[8]North Charlestonis the second-largest city in the metro area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state;Mount PleasantandSummervilleare the next-largest cities.
The traditional parish system persisted until counties were established during theReconstruction Era.[91]Nevertheless, traditional parishes still exist in various capacities, mainly as public service districts. When the city of Charleston was formed, it was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael, which now also includes parts of St. James' Parish, St. George's Parish, St. Andrew's Parish, and St. John's Parish. However, the last two are mostly still incorporated rural parishes.


### Demographics


### 2020 census
As of the2020 census, there were 150,227 people, 58,902 households, and 31,780 families residing in the city.
In 2023, of the 150,227 people in Charleston, about 134,996 of them lived in Charleston County, and 15,231 of them lived in Berkeley County.[97]


### Language
Charleston historically had a large concentration of African Americans who spokeGullah, acreole languagethat developed on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country, and local speech patterns were also influenced by this community. Today, Gullah is still spoken by some African-American residents.[98]However, rapid development since 1980, especially on the surrounding Sea Islands, has attracted residents from outside the area and led to a decline in Gullah's prominence.
The traditional educated Charleston accent has long been noted throughout the state and South. It is typically heard in wealthy European American older people who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raisesayandawin certain environments, and isnonrhotic.Sylvester Primerof theCollege of Charlestonwrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: "Charleston Provincialisms" (1887)[99]and "The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on English, as the earliest settlers spoke it; therefore, it was derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The disappearing "Charleston accent" spoken mainly by older natives is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Many Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as "Chalston".


### Religion
Charleston is known as "the Holy City".[1]Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city's earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the expression was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians' self-satisfied attitude about their city.[100]Many sources, however, traditionally link the term to the many old church spires dotting the skyline of downtown Charleston.[101]Regardless of the nickname's origin, residents have embraced the term and have explained it in more flattering ways.
The Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and theCathedral of St. Luke and St. Paulis today the seat of theAnglican Diocese of South Carolina.St. John's Protestant Episcopal Churchis another historic church in Charleston. Many FrenchHuguenotrefugees settled in Charleston in the early 18th century.[102]TheEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Churchis the oldestAfrican Methodist Episcopalchurch in the SouthernUnited Statesand houses the oldestblack congregationsouth ofBaltimore, Maryland.[103]
South Carolina has long allowedJewsto practice their faith without restriction.Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim, founded in 1749 bySephardic Jewsfrom London, is the fourth-oldest Jewish congregation in the continental United States and was an important site for the development ofReform Judaism.[104]Brith Sholom Beth Israel is the oldestOrthodoxsynagogue in the South, founded by Sam Berlin and otherAshkenaziGerman and Central European Jews in the mid-19th century.[105]
The city's oldestCatholicparish,St. Mary of the Annunciation Catholic Churchis the mother church of Catholicism in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. In 1820, Charleston was established as thesee cityof theDiocese of Charleston, which at the time comprised the Carolinas and Georgia and presently encompasses the state of South Carolina.
TheSupreme Council of the Scottish Rite, established in Charleston in 1801, is considered the mother council of the world byScottish RiteFreemasons.[106]


### Culture
Charleston's culture blends traditional Southern U.S., English, French, and West African elements. The downtown peninsula has several arts, music, local cuisine, and fashion venues.Spoleto Festival USA, held annually in late spring, was founded in 1977 byPulitzer Prize–winning composerGian Carlo Menotti, who sought to establish a counterpart to theFestival dei Due Mondi(the Festival of Two Worlds) inSpoleto, Italy.
Charleston's oldest community theater group, the Footlight Players, has provided theatrical productions since 1931.[107]A variety of performing arts venues includes the historicDock Street Theatre. The annual Charleston Fashion Week held each spring in Marion Square brings in designers, journalists, and clients nationwide.[108]Charleston is known for its local seafood, which plays a key role in the city's renowned cuisine, comprising staple dishes such asgumbo, she-crab soup, fried oysters, Lowcountry boil, deviled crab cakes, red rice, and shrimp and grits. Rice is a staple in many dishes, reflecting the rice culture of the Low Country. The cuisine in Charleston is also strongly influenced by British and French elements.[109]

### Music
TheGullahcommunity has had a tremendous influence on music in Charleston, especially when it comes to the early development ofjazzmusic. In turn, Charleston's music has influenced the rest of the country. Thegeecheedances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspiredEubie Blake's "Charleston Rag" and laterJames P. Johnson's "Charleston", as well as thedance crazethat defined a nation in the 1920s. "Ballin' the Jack", which was a popular dance in the years before "Charleston", was written by native CharlestonianChris Smith.[116]
TheJenkins Orphanagewas established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments, and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on various instruments and could read music expertly.[117]These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie.William "Cat" Anderson,Jabbo Smith, andFreddie Greenare but a few of the alumni who became professional musicians. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success.[118][119]
As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of PresidentsTheodore RooseveltandWilliam Taftand toured the US and Europe.[120]The band also played on Broadway for the play "Porgy" byDuBoseandDorothy Heyward, a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the genuine Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage.[121]Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated withGeorgeandIra Gershwinto turn his novel into the now famous opera,Porgy and Bess(so named to distinguish it from the play). George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 atFolly Beachoutside of Charleston writing this "folk opera", as Gershwin called it.Porgy and Bessis considered one of the first Great American Operas and is widely performed.[122][123]

### Sister cities
Charleston'ssister citiesare:[166][167]
The relationship with Spoleto began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composerGian Carlo Menottiselected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto's annual Festival of Two Worlds. "Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure."[110]
Sister city relation with Panama City was described as follows:[168]
As you may be aware, the city of Charleston, like the city of Panama City, is a historic port City that shares a proud and prosperous history. Our stories are very similar as reflected by our citizens of European, African, Caribbean, native descent, our cuisine, our architecture, and our mutual modern growth in meritime commerce. As Panama City is enjoying a global surge of interest so is Charleston, being ranked as a top destination for travellers, commerce, technology, education, culture and fashion.
— The Honorable Joseph P. Riley Jr., Mayor, City of Charleston 1974–2016
Charleston is also twinned with Speightstown. The first colonists to settle in the region designed the original parts of Charlestown based on the plans of Barbados's capital city,Bridgetown.[169]Many indigo, tobacco, and cotton planters relocated their plantation operations and the people they enslaved from Speightstown to Charleston after the sugarcane industry came to dominate agricultural production in Barbados.[170]
