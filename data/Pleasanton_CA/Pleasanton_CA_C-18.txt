### History


### Pre-contact
The Amador-Livermore Valley, where Pleasanton is located, was home to tribes in theOhlonelanguage group, mainly speakingChochenyo.[10]As of the 1770s seven tribes were present in the valley: the Causen, Pelnen, Seunen, Ssaoan, Ssouyen, Taunan, and Yulien.[10]Each had a territory about 10 miles across, living in villages of 60-90 people.[10]The total population of the valley was about 2000-2500 people.[10]


### 1700s
The first Spanish expedition reached the Amador-Livermore Valley in 1772.[11]Native people from the valley began to joinMission Santa Clara, founded in 1777, in small numbers by the 1790s.[11]Large groups began joining missions afterMission San Josewas founded in 1797.[11]


### 1800s
After Mexico'sindependence from Spainin 1821, the missions weresecularized, the Native people being emancipated and the land given in the form ofranchosto Spanish and Mexican colonists.[11]Pleasanton is located on the lands of theRancho Valle de San JoséandRancho Santa RitaMexican land grants.[12]
Before the establishment of Pleasanton in the 1850s, an earlier settlement in the location was calledAlisal. It was located on the lands of theRancho Santa Rita[13]near the site of a Native American ranchera, around theFrancisco Solano Alviso AdobecalledEl Alisal(The Sycamores),[14]one of the earliest houses built in the valley in 1844. It is still standing and serves as the centerpiece of theAlviso Adobe Community Park. Alisal, nicknamed "The Most Desperate Town in the West", was one of the settlements located alongLa Vereda del Montethat was a haunt and refuge ofbanditsanddesperadosin the era following the beginning of theCalifornia Gold Rush. Main Street shootouts were not uncommon.[citation needed]Banditos such as Claudio Feliz andJoaquin Murrietaambushed prospectors on their way back from thegold rushfields and then sought refuge in Alisal. In the 1860sProcopio, Narciso Bojorques and others took refuge there.[citation needed]Alisal Elementary School reflects the city's original name.
The Rancho Valle de San José grant had been given to Agustín and Juan Pablo Bernal and their brothers-in-law Antonio Suñol and Antonio Maria Pico.[11][when?]In order to safeguard the grant from squatters during theGold Rushin the 1840s-1850s, the Bernal family moved[when?]fromSan Joséto live on their ranch along with John Kottinger, an Austrian immigrant and a lawyer who had married into the family.[11]
"Pleasanton" was chosen as the town's name in the 1860s by John W. Kottinger, an Alameda Countyjustice of the peace, who named it after his friend,Union armycavalry Major GeneralAlfred Pleasonton. A typographical error by a recording clerk in Washington, D.C., apparently led to the current spelling.[12]

On the first Wednesday of summer months, Main Street was blocked to traffic and adopted a street fair atmosphere.

SchweinfurthforPhoebe Hearstin 1898.[37]Phoebe Apperson Hearst had the hacienda remodeled and expanded by architectJulia Morganfor use as her primary residence after her husband died. The estate was built upon a 453-acre (1.83 km2) rancheria obtained in 1886 byGeorge Hearst, who intended to use the location for a race horse farm.[38]Its name was inspired by the circular, carved marble wellhead purchased by Phoebe and William inVerona, Italy and installed in the middle of the courtyard. The hacienda was the only female-owned estate to be mentioned in Porter Garnett'sStately Homes of California. The architecture of the hacienda has been calledCalifornia Mission styleby various sources. The original architect used the term "provincial Spanish Renaissance",[39]while Garnett wrote it would be more accurately called "Hispano-Moresque".[40]Moorish influence was found throughout the estate, such as in the guardhouses which stood on either side of the courtyard entrance.[41]The hacienda was topped by imported red Spanish tiles and had undecorated walls of white stucco. After Phoebe's death in 1919, William had the wellhead and other furniture and objects moved toHearst CastleatSan Simeonand sold the estate.[41]
