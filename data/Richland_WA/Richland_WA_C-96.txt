, Richland is one of the 
Tri-Cities
, and is home to the 
Hanford nuclear site
.





History
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Timeline of the Tri-Cities, Washington


For centuries, the village of Chemna stood at the mouth of the current Yakima River. Today that village site is called Columbia Point. From this village, the 
Wanapum
, 
Yakama
 and 
Walla Walla
 Indians harvested the 
salmon
 runs entering the Yakima River. 
Captain William Clark
 of the 
Lewis and Clark Expedition
 visited the mouth of the Yakima River on October 17, 1805.



Formative years
[
edit
]


In 1904–1905, W.R. Amon and his son Howard purchased 2,300 acres (9 km
2
) and proposed a town site on the north bank of the Yakima River. Postal authorities approved the designation of this town site as Richland in 1905, naming it for Nelson Rich,
[
5
]
 a state legislator and land developer. In 1906, the town was registered at the 
Benton County
 Courthouse. It was incorporated on April 28, 1910, as a Washington Fourth Class City.



World War II
[
edit
]


Richland during the early days of the Hanford project


Richland was a small farm town until the 
U.S. Army
 purchased 640 sq mi (1,660 km
2
) of land – half the size of 
Rhode Island
 – along the Columbia River during World War II, evicting the 300 residents of Richland as well as those of the now vanished towns of 
White Bluffs
 and 
Hanford
 just upriver. The army turned it into a 
bedroom community
 for the workers on its 
Manhattan Project
 facility at the nearby Hanford Engineering Works (now the Hanford site). The population increased from 300 in July and August 1943 to 25,000 by the end of 
World War II
 in August 1945. All land and buildings were owned by the government. Housing was assigned to residents and token rent was collected; families were assigned to houses or duplexes; single people were placed in apartments or barracks. Everything necessary was provided, from free bus service to light bulbs, and trees were planted in people's yards by the government. Much of the city was planned by Spokane architect Gustav Albin Pherson 
and overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers. While there 
were dormitories and barracks built at the time, prefabricated 
duplexes and single family homes are all that survive today. 
Because homes were allocated based on family size and need, 
there were a number of floorplans available. These were each 
identified by a letter of the alphabet, and so came to be known 
as alphabet houses. 

[

]


In 1954 Harold Orlando Monson was elected the first mayor of Richland and traveled to Washington, D.C., to negotiate increased rights (such as private home ownership) for citizens in military cities across the country.

Richland's link to the Army Engineers is suggested by its street nomenclature; many of the streets are named after famous engineers. The main street (
George Washington
 Way) is named after the first president, who was a surveyor; Stevens Drive is named after 
John Frank Stevens
, chief engineer of the 
Panama Canal
 and 
Stevens Pass
; Goethals Drive is named after 
George W. Goethals
, designer of the Panama Canal; and Thayer Drive is named after 
Sylvanus Thayer
, superintendent of 
West Point
 and later founder of the 
Thayer School of Engineering
 at 
Dartmouth College
. The rule is that if alphabet houses reside on a given street, it is named either after an engineer or a type of tree.



The end of the war
[
edit
]


With the end of the war, the Hanford workers' camp, originally located fifteen miles (24 km) north of Richland at the old Hanford town site, was closed down. Although many of the workers moved away as the war effort wound down, some of them moved to Richland, offsetting the depopulation that might otherwise have occurred.



The Cold War boom
[
edit
]


Fears that the 
Soviet Union
's intentions were aggressive set off the 
Cold War
 in 1947. The capacity to produce plutonium was increased beginning in 1947. When the Soviet Union developed and tested their first nuclear weapon in 1949, the U.S. nuclear program was reinvigorated. A second post-WW II expansion began in 1950 as a result of the war in Korea. Richland's Cold War construction boom resulted in Richland's population growing to 27,000 people by 1952. Many of these people lived in a construction camp of trailers located in what is now north Richland. With time, these trailers were vacated and the core city grew. Others lived at 
Camp Columbia
 near 
Horn Rapids
 until the camp was closed in 1950.
In 2005 several dozen houses built 
in the northern part of the core city during this boom 
were added to the 
National Register of Historic Places
 as the 

Gold Coast Historic District
.



Transition to private property
[
edit
]


The government got out of the landlord business in 1957 when the real estate was sold to the residents. Most of the people lived in duplexes; senior tenants were given the option to purchase the building; junior tenants were given the option to purchase lots in a newly platted area of north Richland. Richland was incorporated in 1958 as a chartered First Class City, an open self-governed city. As part of the transition, large areas of undeveloped land became city property. Richland's financial dependency on the federal Hanford facility changed little at this time because Hanford's mission as a weapons materials production site continued during the Cold War years.

President Nixon's visit to Richland


At some point, documents and photographs of the Hanford military facilities became declassified by the U.S. government. Those digitized records are considered to be in the 
public domain
, and are hosted on the online Hanford Document Retrieval System.
[

]

Historical events, such as a visit to the property by President Richard Nixon, are also stored on the database.



After the production boom
[
edit
]


The former Richland City Hall, which has now been demolished


With the shutdown of the last production reactor in 1987, the area transitioned to environmental cleanup and technology. Now, many Richland residents are employed at the Hanford site in its environmental cleanup mission.

Richland High School
's sports teams are called the Bombers, complete with a 
mushroom cloud
 logo. Some of the streets platted after 1958 are named after 
U.S. Army
 
generals
 (such as 
Patton
 Street, 
MacArthur
 Street, 
Sherman
 Street, and 
Pershing
 Avenue) and after various nuclear themes (
Einstein
 Avenue, 
Curie
 Street, 
Proton
 Lane, 
Log
 Lane, and Nuclear Lane). A local museum, the 
Reach Museum
, 
tells the story of the cultural, natural, and scientific history of the 
Hanford Reach
 and 
Columbia Basin
 area; it replaced the
now closed 
Columbia River Exhibition of History, Science, and Technology (CREHST)
 in 2014.

Washington State University, Tri-Cities
 was founded in northern Richland in 1989, growing out of a former Joint Graduate Center which had been affiliated with the 
University of Washington
, 
Oregon State University
, and 
Washington State University
. Richland is also home to 
Kadlec Regional Medical Center
. 
Columbia Basin College
's Medical Training Center is near Kadlec Regional Medical Center.

The Richland Community Center is adjacent to 
Howard Amon Park
, on the east side of the Columbia River. The building was designed by ARC Architects of Seattle, Washington. Many of its rooms have views of the park and Columbia River, which make it a venue for weddings and receptions, family reunions, birthday parties, business, and community meetings. The rooms are also used for a variety of general education and personal enrichment classes including courses in computer/technology, health & fitness, dance, arts & crafts, dog training, home & gardening, language lessons, and martial arts. The Community Center also serves as a gathering place for group recreation and gaming: cribbage, pinochle, bridge, pool, dominoes, and a host of other social activities are available to the public at large.

More recently, the Richland Community Center has hosted a number of important civic events including the Green Living Awards

Richland is included in a bike trail system in the Tri-Cities which is named The 
Sacagawea Heritage Trail
. The trail is a scenic river ride along the Columbia River through the Tri-Cities of Kennewick, Richland and Pasco. It is a 23-mile multipurpose blacktop loop trail on both sides of the river from Sacagawea State Park at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers up to the I-182 bridge at the Columbia Point Marina on the upper end. Three bridges join the trails on both sides, providing a number of ride options. There are numerous trailheads and access parking spots along the route.

Richland lies within a semi-arid, 
shrub-steppe
 environment, and has a number of interesting natural areas within or adjacent to the city:



The Yakima River delta and wetlands lie within Richland and provide habitat for many birds and animals. The area around the Yakima delta provides a wooded variation of the normal shrub-steppe.


The 
Badger Mountain Centennial Preserve
 protects 
Badger Mountain
, located on the edge of Richland in the Richland GMA area. It provides views of the Tri-Cities as well as the Columbia and Yakima rivers. A non-profit group, Friends of Badger Mountain, worked to procure this shrub-steppe area that has the most native vegetation intact, and in 2005 built a trail to the summit. The 2-kilometer trail rises 300 meters above the trailhead in Richland.


The 
Arid Lands Ecology Reserve
, at the western edge of Richland on the Hanford Reservation, is the last remaining large block of undisturbed shrub-steppe habitat in the Pacific Northwest. The site has been closed to the public since the 1940s, preserving its character. It is managed as an environmental research area and wildlife reserve.


North of Richland, the 
Hanford Reach
, the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River in the U.S., provides sightseeing and salmon fishing. This free-flowing stretch flows through the 
Hanford Reach National Monument
, which was created by Presidential proclamation in 2000, and is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Volunteers are working to construct an interpretive center on Richland's Columbia Point at the confluence of the Yakima and Columbia;

 Elevation at the airport is 120 m (390 ft).

In the late 1970s, Richland sought to annex 5 square miles (13 km
2
) of unincorporated land in Franklin County on the east side of the Columbia River, anticipating development following the construction of 
Interstate 182
. The move was blocked by Pasco, who had planned to annex much of the area themselves.

 The Richland city government filed an appeal against the Franklin County Boundary Review Board in 1983 following their approval of Pasco's claim; the 
Washington Supreme Court
 affirmed the Franklin County decision.
