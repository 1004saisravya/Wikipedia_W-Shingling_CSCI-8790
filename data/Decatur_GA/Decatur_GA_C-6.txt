Decatur
 (
/
d
ə
ˈ
k
eɪ
t
ər
/
) is a city and the 
county seat
 of 
DeKalb County
, 
Georgia
, United States, part of the 
Atlanta metropolitan area
. With a population of 24,928 in the 
2020 census
,
[
4
]
 the municipality is sometimes assumed to be larger since multiple ZIP Codes in unincorporated DeKalb County bear Decatur as the address.

The city is served by three 
MARTA
 rail stations (
Decatur
, 
East Lake
, and 
Avondale
). The city is located approximately five miles (eight kilometers) northeast of 
Downtown Atlanta
 and shares its western border with both the city of Atlanta (the Kirkwood and Lake Claire neighborhoods) and unincorporated DeKalb County. The 
Druid Hills
 neighborhood is to the northwest of Decatur.





History
[
edit
]


Early history
[
edit
]


Prior to European settlement, the Decatur area was largely forested (a remnant of 
old-growth forest
 near Decatur is preserved as 
Fernbank Forest
). Decatur was established at the intersection of two Native American trails: the Sandtown, which led east from the 
Chattahoochee River
 at Utoy Creek, and the Shallowford, which follows today's Clairmont Road, and eventually crossed near 
Roswell
. A site for the DeKalb County courthouse was designated in 1822 in what would become downtown Decatur; the city of Decatur was incorporated on December 10, 1823. It was named for 
United States Navy
 
Commodore
 
Stephen Decatur
.

The first settler in the area were farmers or skilled tradesmen of English, Scottish and Irish descent.

American Civil War
[
edit
]


During the 
American Civil War
, Decatur became a strategic site in 
Sherman
's 
Atlanta Campaign
. In July 1864, 
Major-General
 
James McPherson
 occupied the town to cut off the 
Confederates
' supply line from 
Augusta
. On July 22, during the 
Battle of Atlanta
, Confederate 
cavalry
 under 
Major-General
 
Joseph Wheeler
 attacked McPherson's supply wagons and the Union troops left to defend the wagons. A historical marker at the old courthouse marks the site of this skirmish.



We attacked Decatur on the 22d and took the town driving out a Brigade of Infantry and a good deal of Dismounted Cavalry. Our Brigade really took the town, tho' it was supported on both flanks by a Brigade of Cavalry dismounted. The fight lasted about two hours and was very hot for a while. The Yankees had the hills and houses on us and fought very well for a time. Our dash was made to distract attention while Hardee made the real attack on the enemy's flank. We captured over a hundred prisoners and killed and wounded about one hundred and fifty. Our loss about seventy killed and wounded.

20th century
[
edit
]


In the second half of the twentieth century the metropolitan area of Atlanta expanded into unincorporated 
DeKalb County
, eventually surrounding two sides of the town of Decatur. Concurrently, the area experienced 
white flight
, as many residents fled to more distant suburbs. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed dramatic drops in property values. However, more recently the city has regained economic vigor, partially thanks to several long-term downtown development plans that have come to fruition, making Decatur a trendy small 
mixed-use
 district with easy transit to downtown Atlanta. Over the past twenty years, it has gained a local and national reputation as a progressive city with a high level of citizen involvement.

As of the 
2020 United States census
, there were 24,928 people, 8,841 households, and 5,597 families residing in the city.

In recent decades, the city of Decatur has become markedly less diverse in racial terms. In 1990, the city's population was nearly 40 percent African American. By 2010, it had dropped to 20 percent African American, and by 2020 it dropped further to just barely 15 percent African American. Between 1990 and 2020, the proportion of the town's population that was white rose from 60 to 67 percent. One exception to this trend is the fact that Decatur's Latino and Asian populations were minuscule in 1990, and though they each only represented just 5 percent of the town's population in 2020, their increases in proportional terms over the thirty-year period were significant.

Decatur has operated under a Commission-Manager form of government since 1920. The Charter of the City of Decatur establishes the City Commission as the governing and legislative authority of the City government. A five-member City Commission is elected for four-year terms on two-year cycles. Two members are elected from the south side of the city, two from the north side and one is elected at-large. At their organizational meeting each January, the Commissioners elect a mayor and mayor-pro-tem from among their own membership for a one-year term. The mayor is not a separate elected office. The current mayor is Patti Garrett.

 Previous mayors have included 
Leslie Jasper Steele
 (1915), Jack Hamilton, Walter Drake, Mike Mears, Ann A. Crichton, Elizabeth Wilson, William Floyd, Jim Baskett and Scott Candler Sr. (known as Mr. DeKalb).

The Commission appoints a professional City Manager to carry out the policies, directives and day-to-day business of the city. The current city manager is Andrea Arnold.
