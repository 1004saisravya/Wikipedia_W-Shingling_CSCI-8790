Decatur
 is a city in, and the 
county seat
 of, 
DeKalb County
, 
Georgia
, which is part of the 
Atlanta metropolitan area
. With a population of 24,928 in the 
2020 census
,
[
3
]
 the municipality is sometimes assumed to be larger since multiple ZIP Codes in unincorporated DeKalb County bear Decatur as the address. The city is served by three 
MARTA
 rail stations (
Decatur
, 
East Lake
, and 
Avondale
). The city is located approximately five miles (eight kilometers) northeast of 
Downtown Atlanta
 and shares its western border with both the city of Atlanta (the Kirkwood and Lake Claire neighborhoods) and unincorporated DeKalb County. The 
Druid Hills
 neighborhood is to the northwest of Decatur. The unofficial motto of Decatur used by some residents is "Everything is Greater in Decatur."





History
[
edit
]


Early history
[
edit
]


Prior to European settlement, the Decatur area was largely forested (a remnant of old-growth forest near Decatur is preserved as 
Fernbank Forest
). Decatur was established at the intersection of two Native American trails: the Sandtown, which led east from the 
Chattahoochee River
 at Utoy Creek, and the Shallowford, which follows today's Clairmont Road, and eventually crossed near 
Roswell
. A site for the DeKalb County courthouse was designated in 1822 in what would become downtown Decatur; the city of Decatur was incorporated on December 10, 1823. It was named for 
United States Navy
 
Commodore
 
Stephen Decatur
.



Shallowford Road, which led to the Shallow Ford, has been renamed Clairmont Avenue, probably because it does not go to, from or past any place called Clairmont. Covington Road is now Sycamore Street, probably because it leads to Covington and has no Sycamores on it. Nelson's Ferry Road, named after the local family which ran the ferry at the Chattahoochee end of the road, has been named Ponce de Leon after a family prominent, before Castro, in 
Havana
, Cuba.

American Civil War
[
edit
]


During the 
American Civil War
, Decatur became a strategic site in 
Sherman
's 
Atlanta Campaign
. In July 1864, 
Major-General
 
James McPherson
 occupied the town to cut off the 
Confederates
' supply line from 
Augusta
. On July 22, during the 
Battle of Atlanta
, Confederate 
cavalry
 under 
Major-General
 
Joseph Wheeler
 attacked McPherson's supply wagons and the Union troops left to defend the wagons. A historical marker at the old courthouse marks the site of this skirmish.



We attacked Decatur on the 22d and took the town driving out a Brigade of Infantry and a good deal of Dismounted Cavalry. Our Brigade really took the town, tho' it was supported on both flanks by a Brigade of Cavalry dismounted. The fight lasted about two hours and was very hot for a while. The Yankees had the hills and houses on us and fought very well for a time. Our dash was made to distract attention while Hardee made the real attack on the enemy's flank. We captured over a hundred prisoners and killed and wounded about one hundred and fifty. Our loss about seventy killed and wounded.

20th century
[
edit
]


In the second half of the twentieth century the metropolitan area of Atlanta expanded into unincorporated 
DeKalb County
, eventually surrounding two sides of the town of Decatur. Concurrently many well-to-do and middle class 
white Americans
 
fled the area
 to more distant suburbs. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed dramatic drops in property values. However, more recently the city has regained economic vigor, partially thanks to several long-term downtown development plans that have come to fruition, making Decatur a trendy small 
mixed-use
 district with easy transit to downtown Atlanta. Over the past twenty years, it has gained a local and national reputation as a progressive city with a high level of citizen involvement that retains a small-town feel despite its proximity to Atlanta.

The Charter of the City of Decatur establishes the City Commission as the governing and legislative authority of the City government. A five-member City Commission is elected for four-year terms on two-year cycles. Two members are elected from the south side of the city, two from the north side and one is elected at-large. At their organizational meeting each January, the Commissioners elect a mayor and mayor-pro-tem from among their own membership for a one-year term. The mayor is not a separate elected office. The current mayor is Patti Garrett.
