Tampa(/ˈtæmpə/ⓘTAM-pə) is a city on theGulf Coastof the U.S. state ofFlorida. Tampa's borders include the north shore ofTampa Bayand the east shore of Old Tampa Bay. Tampa is the largest city in theTampa Bay areaand thecounty seatofHillsborough County. With an estimated population of 403,364 in 2023, Tampa is the49th-most populous city in the countryand thethird-most populous city in FloridaafterJacksonvilleandMiami.
Tampa was founded as a military center in the 19th century, with the establishment ofFort Brooke. The cigar industry was brought to Tampa byVincente Martinez Ybor, after whomYbor Cityis named. Tampa was reincorporated as a city in 1887 following theCivil War. Tampa's economy is driven by tourism, health care, finance, insurance, technology, construction, and the maritime industry.[13]The bay'sportis the largest in the state, responsible for over $15 billion in economic impact.[14]
Tampa is part of theTampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a four-county area composed of roughly 3.1 million residents,[15]making it the second-largestmetropolitan statistical area(MSA) in the state and the sixth largest in theSoutheastern United States, behindDallas-Fort Worth,Houston,Washington D.C.,Atlanta, andMiami.[16]The Greater Tampa Bay area has over 4 million residents, and generally includes the Tampa andSarasotametro areas.


### Etymology
The earliest instance of the name "Tampa", in the form "Tanpa", appears in the memoirs ofHernando de Escalante Fontaneda, who spent 17 years as a captive of theCalusaand traveled through much of peninsular Florida. He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain, possibly under another chief.ArchaeologistJerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth ofCharlotte Harbor. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured bybarrier islands, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century to the 18th century.Bahía TampaandBahía de Espíritu Santowere each used, at one time or another, for the modern Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.[17][18]
Tampa Bay was labeledBahía de Espíritu Santo(Bay of the Holy Spirit) in the earliest Spanish maps of Florida. It became known as B. Tampa (Bahía Tampaor Tampa Bay) as early as 1576.[19][20]In 1601, "B. Tampa", corresponding to Tampa Bay, appeared for the first time on a printed map in Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas's Description del Destricto del Audiencia de la Espanola, from his book Descripcion de las Indias Ocidentales, printed in Madrid.[21]
A 1705 British map also shows B. Tampa, with "Carlos Bay" for Charlotte Harbor to the south. A 1748 British map had "B. del Spirito Santo" for Tampa Bay and "Carlos Bay" to the south. A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as "San Fernando". As late as 1774,Bernard Romanscalled Tampa Bay "Bay of Espiritu Santo", with "Tampa Bay" restricted to the Northwest arm, what is now Old Tampa Bay, and the northeast arm named "Hillsborough Bay". The name may have come from the Calusa language or possibly, theTimucua language. Some scholars have compared "Tampa" to "itimpi", which means "close to" or "nearby" in theCreek language, but its meaning is not known.[18]
In 1849, when the pioneer community living near theU.S. Armyoutpost ofFort Brookewas incorporated, it was called "Tampa Town". In 1855, the name was shortened to simply "Tampa".[17][18]
People from Tampa are generally known as "Tampans", "Tampanians", or "Tampeños".[22]In 2014, local authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of theTampa Bay Timessuggest that "Tampan" was historically more common, while "Tampanian" became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult.[23]A mix of Cuban, Italian, and Spanish immigrants began arriving in the late 1800s to found and work in the new communities ofYbor CityandWest Tampa. By about 1900, these newcomers came to be known as "Tampeños", or "Tampeñas" for females, a term that is still sometimes used to refer to their descendants living in the area, and potentially, to all residents of Tampa regardless of their ethnic background.[23][24][25][8]


### History


### Indigenous peoples and European exploration
The shores ofTampa Bayhave been inhabited for thousands of years. A variant of theWeeden Island culturedeveloped in the area by about 2,000 years ago. Archeological evidence suggests that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline, with little evidence of farming. At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, several chiefdoms of theSafety Harbor culturedominated the area.[26]
Early Spanish explorers interacted most extensively with theTocobaga, whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today'sSafety HarborinPinellas County. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga, and theCalusa, who lived to the south, there is less surviving documentation describing thePohoy, who lived near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today's downtown Tampa. Evidence suggests that the language and culture of the Pohoy and other lesser-known groups around the bay were very similar to that of the Tocobaga.[27][28]
Expeditions led byPánfilo de NarváezandHernando de Sotolanded near Tampa, but neitherconquistadorstayed long. There is no natural gold or silver in Florida, and the native inhabitants repulsed Spanish attempts to establish a permanent settlement or convert them toCatholicism. The fighting resulted in a few deaths, but the many more deaths were caused by infectious diseases brought from Europe, which devastated the population of Native Americans across Florida and the entire Western Hemisphere. The indigenous cultures of the Tampa Bay area collapsed by around 1600, leaving the west coast ofSpanish Floridalargely depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.[29]
In the mid-18th century, events in the American colonies and the early United States drove theSeminolepeople into northern Florida. They did not move into central Florida until after the United States gained control of Florida in 1821.[30][31]
Before the American period, the Tampa Bay area had a handful of residents:Cubanand Native American fishermen who established small seasonal camps called "ranchos" on the shores of Tampa Bay. The largest was at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek in today'sHyde Parkneighborhood alongBayshore Boulevard.[32]


### U.S. control
After purchasing Florida from Spain in 1821, the United States builtfortsandtrading postsin the new territory.[33]Fort Brookewas established in January 1824 at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, inDowntown Tampa.[34]
Tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during theSecond Seminole Warfrom 1835 to 1842, after which the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned.[35]
Floridabecame the 27th state on March 3, 1845. On January 18, 1849, Tampa was officially incorporated as the "Village of Tampa." It was home to 185 civilians, or 974 total residents including military personnel, in 1850.[36][37]Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December 15, 1855.[38]


### Civil War and Reconstruction
During theCivil War, Florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form theConfederate States of America, and Fort Brooke was defended by Confederate troops.Martial lawwas declared in Tampa in January 1862, and Tampa's city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war.[39]
In 1861, theUnionNavy set up ablockadearound many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy. Several US Navy ships were stationed near the mouth ofTampa Bay, but smallblockade running shipswere often able to slip by the blockade to deliver cattle to Spanish Cuba, earning gold for the Confederate cause.[40][41][42]On June 30, 1862, the gunboatUSSSagamoresailed intoTampa Bayand opened fire on Fort Brooke, which returned fire. TheSagamorewithdrew after a few hours, and theBattle of Tampacaused little damage. During theBattle of Fort Brookeon October 16 and theBattle of Ballast Pointon October 18, 1863, Union forces inflicted serious damage to Tampa's economy when, under the cover of another bombardment of the fort, troops landed and destroyed two blockade running ships that had been hidden upstream along the Hillsborough River.[43]
In May 1864, Union troops landed again and took Fort Brooke largely unopposed. They destroyed much of the fort's facilities and confiscated the remaining military supplies other than the cannons, which they tossed into the Hillsborough River, then left the "desolate" town after two days.[44]
TheCivil War endedin April 1865 with a Confederate defeat. In May 1865, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part ofReconstruction. They remained until August 1869.[citation needed]
During the immediate post-war period, Tampa was a poor, isolated fishing village with about 1,000 residents and little industry.Yellow fever, borne by mosquitoes from nearby swamps, broke out several times during the 1860s and 1870s, causing more residents to leave.[45]In 1869, residents voted to abolish the city of Tampa government.[46]
In 1870, the population of "Tampa Town" was about 800, and dropped to about 700 by 1880. Fort Brooke was decommissioned in 1883, further impacting the local economy in the short run, but opening up the waterfront for development. Except for twocannonsdisplayed on theUniversity of Tampacampus, all traces of the fort are gone.[44]


### 1880s economic prosperity
In the mid-1880s, Tampa's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. In 1883,phosphatewas discovered in theBone Valleyregion southeast of Tampa. The mineral, vital for the production offertilizersand other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter.
The discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa—all in the mid-1880s—were crucial to Tampa's development. The once-struggling village of Tampa became a bustlingboomtownalmost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.[47]
In late 1883,Henry B. Plant's narrow-gaugeSouth Florida Railroadreached Tampa and its port, connecting the small town to the nation's railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa's overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. Plant's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area. Phosphate andcommercial fishingexports could be sent north by rail,[48]and many new products were brought into the Tampa market, along with the first tourists.
The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade enticedVicente Martinez Yborto move hiscigarmanufacturing operations to Tampa fromKey West. Proximity toCubamade importation of "clear Havana tobacco" easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.[47]
Since Tampa was still a small town at the time, with a population less than 5,000, Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers.Ybor City's factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. ManyItalianand a few Eastern EuropeanJewishimmigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers.[49]
By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants builtWest Tampa, another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two "Latin" communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the "Cigar Capital of the World".[49]


### Early 20th century
During the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar-making industry was the backbone of Tampa's economy. The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars—in the peak year of 1929, over 500 million cigars were hand rolled in Tampa.[50]
In 1904, a civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselvesYe Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, named after local mythical pirate José Gaspar, and staged an "invasion" of the city followed by a parade. With a few exceptions, theGasparilla Pirate Festivalhas been held every year since.[51]


### Bolita and organized crime
Beginning in the late 19th century, illegalbolitalotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over byCharlie Wall, the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time. Bolita was able to openly thrive only because ofkick-backsand bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials, and many were on the take.[52]
Profits from the bolita lotteries andProhibition-era bootlegging led to the development of severalorganized crimefactions in Tampa. Charlie Wall was the first major boss, but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control bySicilianmafiosoSanto Trafficante Sr.and his faction in the 1950s. After his death in 1954 from cancer, control passed to his son,Santo Trafficante Jr., who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and intoBatista-eraCuba.[53][54]
The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s, whenEstes Kefauver's travelingorganized crime hearingscame to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials. Although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.[52]


### Mid to late 20th century
Tampa grew considerably as a result ofWorld War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the conflict, construction began onMacDill Field, which served as a main base forArmy Air Corpsand laterArmy Air Forcesoperations just before and during World War II, with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and surrounding counties. At the end of the war, MacDill remained as an active military installation, while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control. Two of these auxiliary fields later became the present-dayTampa International AirportandSt. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport. With the establishment of an independentU.S. Air Forcein 1947, MacDill Field becameMacDill Air Force Base.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Tampa had record-setting population growth that has not been seen since. This growth spurred expansion of Tampa's highways and bridges, bringing thousands into the city and creating opportunities for Tampa business owners, who welcomed the influx of tourists and new residents. It was during this time period in Tampa's history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed –Busch GardensandLowry Park. Many of the well-known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of Tampa were established during this time period.[55]
TheUniversity of South Floridawas established in North Tampa in 1956 and opened for students in September 1960.[56]The school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial developments in the previously agriculture-dominated area around the new campus. Overall, Tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals, schools, churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth. Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas.[55]
In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tampa's population as being 80.0% white and 19.7% black.[57]
Four attempts have been made toconsolidatethe municipal government of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County, in 1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972, all of which failed at the ballot box. The greatest loss was the most recent attempt in 1972, with the final tally being 33,160 (31%) in favor and 73,568 (69%) against the proposed charter.[58]
The biggest recent growth of Tampa was the development ofNew Tampa, which started in 1988 when the city annexed a mostly rural area of 24 sq mi (62 km2) betweenI-275andI-75.[citation needed]
East Tampa, historically a mostly black community, was the scene of severalrace riotsduring and for some time after the period of racial segregation, mainly due to problems between residents and theTampa Police Department.[59][60]


### Geography


### Topography
According to theUnited States Census Bureau, Tampa has a total area of 175.3 sq mi (453.9 km2), including 113.4 sq mi (293.7 km2) of land and 61.8 sq mi (160.1 km2) (35.3%) of water.[11]The highest point in Tampa is only 48 ft (15 m) above sea level. Tampa is bordered by two bodies of water,Old Tampa BayandHillsborough Bay, which flow together to formTampa Bay, which flows into theGulf of Mexico.[61]
TheHillsborough Riverflows into Hillsborough Bay, passing directly in front ofDowntown Tampaand supplying Tampa's main source of fresh water. ThePalm Riveris a smaller river, flowing from just east of the city intoMcKay Bay, which is a smaller inlet, sited at the northeast end of Hillsborough Bay.[61]Tampa's geography is marked by the Interbay Peninsula, which divides Hillsborough Bay in the east, from Old Tampa Bay in the west.


### Cityscape
Tampa is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities annexed by the growing city. Generally, Tampa is divided into the following areas:Downtown Tampa,New Tampa,West Tampa,East Tampa,North Tampa, andSouth Tampa. Well-known neighborhoods includeYbor City,Forest Hills,Ballast Point,Sulphur Springs,Seminole Heights,Tampa Heights,Palma Ceia,Hyde Park,Davis Islands,Harbour Island,Tampa Palms,College Hill,Water Street,Channelsideand non-residential areas ofGaryand theWestshore Business District.
Tampa displays a wide variety of architectural designs and styles. Most of Tampa's high rises demonstratepost-modern architecture. The design for the renovatedTampa Museum of Artdisplays post-modern architecture, while the city hall and theTampa Theatrebelong toArt Decoarchitecture.
The Tampa mayorPam Ioriomade the redevelopment ofTampa's downtown, especially residential development, a priority.[62]Several residential and mixed-development high-rises have been constructed. Another of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was theTampa Riverwalk, a mixed-use path along the Hillsborough River in downtown. Channelside was approved to undergo major renovations byTampa Bay LightningownerJeff Vinikalong withBill Gatesand other investors.[63]Several museums have opened, including new homes for theTampa Bay History Center, theGlazer Children's Museum, and theTampa Museum of Art.[64]The breakdown of development for the rest of the plan is as follows: 39% residential units, 29% office space, 15% hotels, 8% retail, 7% other, and 2% cultural uses.[65]MayorBob Buckhorncontinued these developments, which are bearing fruit during the term of MayorJane Castor.
Tampa is the site of severalskyscrapers. Overall, there are 30 completed buildings that rise over 250 ft (76 m) high. Tampa also has 147 high-rises,[66]second only toMiamiin the state of Florida. Thetallest building in the cityis100 North Tampa, formerly the AmSouth Building, which rises 42floorsand 579 ft (176 m) in Downtown Tampa.[67]The structure was completed in 1992, and is the tallest building in Florida outside of Miami andJacksonville.[67]
TheSulphur Springs Water Tower, a landmark in theSulphur Springssection of the city, stands 214 feet tall and was built by Grover Poole in the late 1920s.[68]This1920s boom period for Floridaalso saw the construction of an ornatemovie palace, theTampa Theatre, aMediterranean revival on Davis Islands, andBayshore Boulevard, which borders Hillsborough Bay fromdowntown Tampato areas in South Tampa. The road has a 6 mi (10 km) continuous sidewalk on the eastern end, the longest in the world.[69][70]
TheYbor CityDistrict is home to several buildings on theNational Register of Historic Placesand has been declared aNational Historic Landmark. Notable structures includeEl Centro Español de Tampa,Centro Asturiano de Tampaand othersocial clubs built in the early 1900s. Including L'Unione Italiana or the Italian Club, at 1731 East 7th Avenue in Ybor City. The Italian Club mission "is to preserve and honor the culture, traditions and heritage of the Italian Community and to maintain the historical facility as a functioning memorial to the working class immigrants."[71]Babe Zaharias Golf Coursein theForest Hillsarea of Tampa has been designated a Historical Landmark by the National Register of Historic Places. It was bought in 1949 by the famous"Babe" Didrikson Zaharias, who had a residence nearby, and closed upon her death. In 1974, the city of Tampa opened the golf course to the public.[72]
The Story of Tampa, a public painting by Lynn Ash, is a 4 ft × 8 ft (1.2 m × 2.4 m) oil on masonite mural that weaves together many of the notable aspects of Tampa's unique character and identity. It was commissioned in 2003 by the city's Public Art Program and is in the lobby of the Tampa Municipal Office Building.[73]
Park Tower, originally the First Financial Bank of Florida, is the first substantial skyscraper in downtown Tampa. Completed in 1973, it was the tallest skyscraper in Tampa until the completion of One Tampa City Center in 1981.[74]The Rivergate building, a cylindrical structure known as the "Beer Can building", was featured in the movieThe Punisher.
Spanning the southern part of Tampa Bay is the massive steel-spanSunshine Skyway Bridge.
Tampa is home to theBro Bowl, one of the last remainingskateparksbuilt during skateboarding's "Golden Era" in the 1970s.[75]It opened in 1979 and was constructed by Tampa Parks and Recreation in 1978.[76]It was the first public skatepark to be constructed in Florida and the third on theEast Coast.[77]
Other Tampa landmarks include theTampa Riverwalk, which is a 2.6-mile-long (4.2-kilometer) open space and pedestrian trail development along the Hillsborough River, andCurtis Hixon Waterfront Park.


### Climate
The Tampa Bay area has ahumid subtropical climate(KöppenCfa), although due to its location on the Florida peninsula on Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it shows some characteristics of a tropical climate. Tampa has hot and humid summers with frequentthunderstormsand dry and mild winters. Average highs range from 71 to 91 °F (22 to 33 °C) year round, and lows 53 to 77 °F (12 to 25 °C). The city of Tampa is split between twoUSDAclimate zones. In the 2012USDAPlant Hardiness Zone Map, Tampa is listed asUSDAzone 9b north of Kennedy Boulevard away from the bay and 10a near the shorelines and in the interbay peninsula south of Kennedy Boulevard. Zone 10a is about the northern limit of wherecoconut palmsandroyal palmscan be grown, although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa. Recently, certain palm tree species in the area, along with the rest of the state, have been and continue to be severely affected by a plant disease calledTexas phoenix palm decline, which has caused a considerable amount of damage to various local palm tree landscapes and threatens the native palm tree species in the region.[78]


### Tropical storms
Though threatened by tropical systems almost every hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, Tampa has seldom felt major effects fromtropical stormsorhurricanes. No hurricane has madelandfallin the immediate Tampa Bay area since the category 41921 Tampa Bay hurricanemade landfall nearTarpon Springsand caused extensive damage throughout the region.[79][80]
Over the past few decades, four major hurricanes were forecast to hit the Tampa Bay area from the south-southwest, which is a worst-case track that would result in a maximumstorm surgeevent:Hurricane Donna(1960),Hurricane Charley(2004),Hurricane Irma(2017), andHurricane Ian(2022).[81][82]All of these storms veered to the east or northeast before reaching Tampa Bay and instead made landfall down the coast, resulting in serious damage insouthwest Florida. Irma had the greatest effect on Tampa. It made landfall nearMarco Islandon September 10, 2017, and moved due north, passing through eastern Hillsborough County as a Category 1 storm and causing widespread issues in the area, particularly disrupting theelectrical gridfor several days.[83]
Because of tremendous population growth and coastal development in the century since the last hurricane landfall, combined with rising sea levels due toclimate change, the Tampa Bay Area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to a direct hit from a major storm.[79]


### Seasonal trends
Summertime weather patterns predominate from late May to early October, which is the region's rainy season.[84]Daily weather is very consistent during this period, with daytime highs averaging about 91 °F (33 °C), lows usually in the mid- to upper 70s °F (23–25 °C), highhumidity, and a regular chance of rain, especially in the afternoon. Mainly due to the proximity of large bodies of water, the official high temperature has never hit 100 °F (37.8 °C) – the all-time record high temperature is 99 °F (37 °C), first recorded on June 5, 1985, and tied on June 26, 2020.[85]
Afternoon thunderstorms are regularly generated by the interaction of theGulfandAtlanticsea breezesand are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the Tampa Bay area and nearby inland areas ofCentral Floridaare recognized as the "Lightning Capital of North America". Afternoon thundershowers occasionally intensify into asevere thunderstorm, bringing heavy downpours, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and sometimes hail.[86]
Average temperatures gradually fall beginning in September, and average daily rainfall amounts decrease as autumn progresses. November is usually Tampa's driest month. However, rain totals in the fall can be augmented by passing tropical systems, which can dump several inches of rain.
Winter in the area is generally dry and cooler. Average high temperatures range from the low to mid-70s °F (21–23 °C) during the day to the low to mid-50s °F (11–13 °C) at night. Occasionalcold frontspush through the area during the season, usually bringing a brief period of rain followed by daytime highs in the 50s °F (10–13 °C) and nighttime lows near 40 °F (4 °C) for a day or two. Tampa experiences occasional frosts, with an annual mean minimum temperature of 32.8 °F (0.4 °C)
Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture andaquaculture, hard freezes, although quite rare, are a major concern. Hard freezes, defined as a temperature of 28 °F (−2.2 °C) or below for several hours, occur rarely in the Tampa area, every five to twenty years depending on the exact location. The last widespread freeze occurred on the morningof January 18, 2018, when the official temperature at Tampa International Airport dropped to 29 °F (−2 °C).[87][88]The lowest temperature ever recorded in Tampa was 18 °F (−8 °C) on December 13, 1962.[86]The only snowfall officially recorded in Tampa occurred on January 19, 1977, with local accumulations ranging between a trace and 0.2 in (0.5 cm).[89]
Tampa has a slow increase in average temperatures beginning in mid-February, and spring brings mostly warm and sunny weather to the area. While temperatures in late spring approach summertime values, the rainy season does not usually begin until June, leading to the threat ofbrush firesfrom approximately late March until May. Occasionally, a late-season cold front pushes through the area, potentially bringing a brief round of severe weather followed by a few days of unseasonably cool temperatures.


### Demographics
Tampa first appeared in the 1850 U.S. Census with a total recorded population of 974, which included soldiers stationed at Fort Brooke.[97]Tampa did not report separately in 1860.[98]
