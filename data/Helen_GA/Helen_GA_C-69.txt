### History

Formerly a logging town that was in decline, the city resurrected itself by becoming a replica of aBavarianalpinetown, in theAppalachiansinstead of theAlps. This design is mandated through zoning first adopted in 1969, so that the classic south-German style is present on every building, even on the small number of national franchisees present (such asHuddle HouseandWendy's).
In 1975,DOCUMERICAphotographer Al Stephenson documented the life, recreation, and economy of the Helen area before and during the construction of Alpine Helen.
