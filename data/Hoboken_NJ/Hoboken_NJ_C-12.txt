Hoboken(/ˈhoʊboʊkən/HOH-boh-kən;[22]Unami:Hupokàn)[23]is acityinHudson Countyin theU.S. stateofNew Jersey. Hoboken is part of theNew York metropolitan areaand is the site ofHoboken Terminal, a majortransportation hub. As of the2020 United States census, the city's population was 60,419,[11][12]an increase of 10,414 (+20.8%) from the2010 censuscount of 50,005,[24]which in turn reflected an increase of 11,428 (+29.6%) from the 38,577 counted in the2000 census.[25]TheCensus Bureau'sPopulation Estimates Programcalculated a population of 57,010 for 2023,[14]making it the708th-most populous municipalityin the nation.[13]With more than 42,400 inhabitants per square mile (16,400/km2) in data from the 2010 census, Hoboken was ranked as the third-mostdensely populated municipality in the United Statesamong cities with a population above 50,000.[26]In the 2020 census, the city's population density climbed to more than 48,300 inhabitants per square mile (18,600/km2) of land, ranked fourth in the county behindGuttenberg,Union CityandWest New York.[11][27]
Hoboken was first settled by Europeans as part of thePavonia, New Netherlandcolony in the 17th century. During the early 19th century, the city was developed byColonel John Stevens, first as a resort and later as a residential neighborhood. Originally part ofBergen Townshipand laterNorth Bergen Township, it became a separate township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. Hoboken is the location of the first recorded game ofbaseballand of theStevens Institute of Technology, one of the oldest technological universities in the United States. It is also known as the birthplace and hometown ofFrank Sinatra; various streets and parks in the city have been named after him.
Located on theHudson Waterfront, the city was an integral part of thePort of New York and New Jerseyand was home to major industries for most of the 20th century. The character of the city has changed from an artsy industrial vibe from the days when Maxwell House coffee, Lipton tea, Hostess Cupcakes, andWonder Breadcalled Hoboken home, to one of trendy shops and expensive condominiums.[28]It was ranked 2nd inNiche's "2019 Best Places to Live in Hudson County" list,[29]and 1st in 2022.[30]


### History


### Etymology
The name Hoboken was chosen by ColonelJohn Stevenswhen he bought land, on a part of which the city still sits. TheLenape, later called Delaware Indian tribe ofNative Americans, referred to the area as the "land of the tobacco pipe", most likely to refer to thesoapstonecollected there to carvetobacco pipes, and used a phrase that became "Hopoghan Hackingh".[31][32][33]LikeWeehawken, its neighbor to the north, as well asCommunipawandHarsimusto the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue.Hoebuck, old Dutch for high bluff, and likely referring to Castle Point, the district of the city highest above sea level, was used during the colonial era, and was later spelled asHobuck,[34]Hobock,[35]Hobuk[36]andHoboocken.[37]However, in the nineteenth century, the name was changed to Hoboken, influenced byFlemishimmigrants, and afolk etymologyhad emerged, linking the town of Hoboken to the similarly-namedHobokendistrict ofAntwerp.[38]
Hoboken has been nicknamed the Mile Square City,[1]but it actually occupies about 1.25 sq mi (3.2 km2) of land.[2]During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated byGerman languagespeakers who sometimes called it "Little Bremen", many of whom are buried inHoboken Cemetery, North Bergen.[39][40]


### Early-European arrival and colonial period
Hoboken was originally an island which was surrounded by theHudson Riveron the east and tidal lands at the foot of theNew Jersey Palisadeson the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of theHackensack, aphratryof theLenni Lenape, who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes.[31]
The first recorded European to lay claim to the area wasHenry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for theDutch East India Company, who anchored his ship theHalve Maen(Half Moon) atWeehawken Coveon October 2, 1609.[41]An entry made in the journal of Hudson's mate, Robert Juet, on that date, is the earliest known reference to the area today known as Hoboken, and would be the last known such reference until twenty years later.[42]Soon after the area became part of the province ofNew Netherland.[citation needed]
In 1630,Michael Reyniersz Pauw, a burgemeester (mayor) ofAmsterdamand a director of theDutch West India Company, received a land grant aspatroonon the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named theNorth River. Three Lenape sold the land that became Hoboken and part of Jersey City for 80 fathoms (146 m) ofwampum, 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle, and half a barrel of beer.[41]These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw, whose Latinized name isPavonia, failed to settle the land, and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the company in 1633.[citation needed]
It was later acquired by Hendrick Van Vorst, who leased part of the land to Aert Van Putten, a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North America's first. Inseries of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia, as the colony was then known, were ordered back to New Amsterdam.[43]
In 1664, the English took possession ofNew Amsterdamwith little to no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674–1675, the area became part ofEast Jersey, and the province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part ofBergen County, where it remained until the creation ofHudson Countyon February 22, 1840. English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained sparsely populated and agrarian.[citation needed]
Eventually, the land came into the possession of WilliamBayard, who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became aLoyalist Toryafter the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the renamed Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of theRevolutionary War, Bayard's property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as "William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck" was bought at auction by ColonelJohn Stevensfor £18,360 (then $90,000).[41]


### 19th century
In the early 19th century, ColonelJohn Stevensdeveloped the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites.[44]On October 11, 1811, Stevens' ship theJuliana, began to operate as aferrybetween Manhattan and Hoboken, making it the world's first commercial steam ferry.[45]In 1825, he designed and built asteam locomotivecapable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate.[46]Sybil's Cave, a cave with a natural spring, was opened in 1832 and visitors came to pay a penny for a glass of water from the cave which was said to have medicinal powers.[47]In 1841, the cave became a legend, whenEdgar Allan Poewrote "The Mystery of Marie Roget" about an event that took place there.[48]The cave was closed in the late 1880s after the water was found to be contaminated, and it was shut and in the 1930s and filled with concrete, before it was reopened in 2008.[49]Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded theHoboken Land and Improvement Company, which laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid.[50]
Hoboken was originally formed as atownshipon April 9, 1849, from portions ofNorth Bergen Township. As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on March 29, 1855, ratified an Act of theNew Jersey Legislaturesigned the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born.[51]In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener becameHoboken's first mayor. On March 15, 1859, the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and North Bergen Township.[51]
Based on a bequest fromEdwin A. Stevens,Stevens Institute of Technologywas founded atCastle Pointin 1870, at the site of theStevens family's former estate, as the nation's firstmechanical engineeringcollege.[52]
By the late 19th century, shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and theDelaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad(later theErie Lackawanna Railroad) developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront, with the presentNJ Transitterminal designed by architectKenneth Murchisonconstructed in 1907.[53]It was also during this time that German immigrants, who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of theHamburg America Line, though anti-German sentiment during World War I led to a rapid decline in the German community.[54]In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home toKeuffel and Esser's three-story factory and in 1884, to Tietjen and Lang Drydock (laterTodd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century includedMaxwell House,Lipton Tea, andHostess.[55]
The first officially recorded game ofbaseballtook place in Hoboken in 1846 betweenKnickerbocker Cluband New York Nine atElysian Fields.[56]In 1845, the Knickerbocker Club, which had been founded byAlexander Cartwright, began using Elysian Fields to playbaseballdue to the lack of suitable grounds onManhattan.[57]Team members included players of theSt George's Cricket Club, the brothersHarryandGeorge Wright, andHenry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term "America's Pastime".[citation needed]
By the 1850s, severalManhattan-based members of theNational Association of Base Ball Playerswere using the grounds as their home field while St. George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859,George Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team, a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become the national pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players.Harry WrightandGeorge Wrightthen became two of the first professional baseball players in the United States when Aaron Champion raised funds to found theCincinnati Red Stockingsin 1869.[citation needed]
In 1865, the grounds hosted a championship match between theMutual Clubof New York City and theAtlantic ClubofBrooklynthat was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in theCurrier & Iveslithograph"The American National Game of Base Ball".[58]
With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences inBrooklyn, enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence ofElysian Fieldsdiminished. In 1868 the leadingManhattanclub,Mutual, shifted its home games to theUnion Groundsin Brooklyn. In 1880, the founders of theNew York MetropolitansandNew York Giantsfinally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as thePolo Grounds.[citation needed]


### 20th century
Few nonwhites had settled in Hoboken by 1901. TheBrooklyn Eagleclaimed that an unwrittensundown townpolicy prevented African Americans from residing or working there.[59]
When the U.S. enteredWorld War I, theHamburg-American Linepiers in Hoboken andNew Orleanswere taken undereminent domain.[60]Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many German immigrants were forcibly moved toEllis Islandor left the city of their own accord.[61]Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "doughboys", passed through the city.[62]Their hope for an early return led toGeneral Pershing's slogan, "Heaven, Hell or Hoboken... by Christmas."[63]
Following the war,Italians, mostly stemming from theAdriaticport city ofMolfetta, became the city's major ethnic group, with theIrishalso having a strong presence.[64]While the city experienced theGreat Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the tenements were bustling. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. ThePort Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was established on April 30, 1921, oversaw the development of theHolland Tunnel(completed in 1927) and theLincoln Tunnel(in 1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and New York City, bypassing the waterfront.[citation needed]
The war facilitated economic growth in Hoboken, as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,Todd Shipyards), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the 1950s, the economy was still driven by Todd Shipyards,Maxwell House,[65]Lipton Tea,HostessandBethlehem Steeland companies with big plants were still not inclined to invest in major infrastructure elsewhere.[citation needed]
In the 1960s, working pay and conditions began to deteriorate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities onNewark Bay, and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close by ones inBergenandPassaicCounties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such asPaterson,Elizabeth,Camden, and neighboringJersey City.[66]
The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights.[67]Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notablyPuerto Ricans, kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called "the avenue", was never boarded up, and the tight-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens remained a premier technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the "old neighborhood" to shop for delicatessen.[citation needed]
In 1975, the western part of theKeuffel and Esser Manufacturing Complex(known as "Clock Towers") was converted into residential apartments, after having been an architectural, engineering and drafting facility from 1907 to 1968;[68]the eastern part portion became residential apartments in 1984 (now called theGrand Adams).[68]
TheHudson Waterfrontdefined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of Lipton Tea and Maxwell House, and thedrydocksofBethlehem Shipbuilding CorporationandTodd Shipbuildingdominated the northern portion for many years. On June 30, 1900,a large fireat theNorddeutscher Lloydpiers killed numerous people and caused almost $10 million in damage.[69][70]The southern portion (which had been a U.S. base of theHamburg-American Line) was seized by the federal government undereminent domainat the outbreak ofWorld War I, after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.[citation needed]
With the development of theInterstate Highway Systemandcontainerizationshipping facilities (particularly atPort Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned.[41]A large swath of River Street, known as theBarbary Coastfor its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant mariners, and other seamen) was leveled as part of anurban renewalproject. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with thePort Authoritygave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with thePort Authority of New York and New Jersey, various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and "open spaces" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilizedPier A).[71]
The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities[72][73]were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment condominiums, some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea,[74]and the Machine Shop, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum).[75]Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,Frank Sinatra ParkandSinatra Drivehonor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon "Good to the Last Drop" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by theserpentine rockoutcropping atop of which sits Stevens Institute of Technology (which also owns some, as yet, undeveloped land on the river). At the foot of the cliff isSybil's Cave(where 19th century day-trippers once came to "take the waters" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of theHudson River Waterfront Walkway, a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from theBayonne BridgetoGeorge Washington Bridgeand provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline. As of 2017, the city was considering usingeminent domainto take over the last operating maritime industry in the city, the Union Dry Dock.[76][77]
During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-20th-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which were arson.[78][79][80]Applied Housing, a real-estate investment firm, used federal government incentives to renovate "sub-standard" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly known asSection 8), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly mobile commuters, and "bohemian types" interested in the socioeconomic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) less expensive rents, all a quick, train hop away.
These trends in development resembled similar growth and change patterns inBrooklynand downtownJersey Cityand Manhattan'sEast Village—and to a lesser degree,SoHoandTriBeCa—which previously had not been residential. Empty lots were built on, tenements were transformed into luxury condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of theWorld Trade Centerintensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,transit villagesare now being promoted.[81]Once ablue collartown characterized by live poultry shops and drab taverns, it has since been transformed into a town filled with gourmet shops and luxury condominiums.[79]
In October 2012,Hurricane Sandycaused widespread flooding in Hoboken, leaving 1,700 homes flooded and causing $100 million in damage after the storm "filled up Hoboken like a bathtub",[82]leaving the city without electricity for days, and requiring the summoning of theNational Guard.[83]Workers in Hoboken had the highest rate of public transportation use in the nation, with 56% commuting daily via mass transit.[84]Hurricane Sandy caused seawater to flood half the city, crippling the PATH station at Hoboken Terminal when more than 10 million gallons of water dumped into the system. In December 2013 Mayor Dawn Zimmer testified before a U.S. Senate Committee on the impact the storm had on Hoboken's businesses and residents,[85][86]and in January 2014 she stated that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, a member of governorChris Christie's cabinet, deliberately held back Hurricane Sandy relief funds from the city in order to pressure her to approve a Christie ally's developmental project,[87][88]a charge that the Christie administration denied.[89][90][91]In June 2014, theUnited States Department of Housing and Urban Developmentallocated $230 million to Hoboken as part of its Rebuild by Design initiative, adding levees, parks, green roofs,retention basinsand other infrastructure to help the low-lying riverfront city protect itself from ordinary flooding and build a network of features to help Hobokenfuture-proofitself against subsequent storms.[92]
The project included expanding the city's sewer capacity, incorporatingcisternsand basins into parks and playgrounds, redesigning streets to minimize traffic accidents, and collect and redirect waster. By September 2023, the improvements were so successful that when a storm hit the area that month, depositing 3.5 inches on the city, including 1.44 inches during the hour coinciding with high tide, only a few inches of standing water remains at three of the city's 277 intersections by the evening, resulting in only three towed cars, and no cancelation of any city events. In an article that November forThe New York Times, Michael Kimmelman compared this to the storm's effects in New York City, whose government focused onflood wallsandbreakwaters, but not rainwater, resulting in several subway lines being submerged in water, and thigh-high water levels in Brooklyn streets. For this, the article hailed Hoboken as a "climate change success story."[83]


### Geography
According to theUnited States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2 square miles (5.2 square kilometres), including 1.25 sq mi (3.2 km2) of land and 0.75 sq mi (1.9 km2) of water (37.50%).[93]
Hoboken lies on the west bank of the Hudson River betweenWeehawkenandUnion Cityto the north andJersey City(the county seat) to the south and west.[94][95][96]Directly across the Hudson River are theManhattan, New York City neighborhoods of theWest VillageandChelsea.
Hoboken is laid out in agrid. North–south streets are named (Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson, Harrison, and Clinton, for example). The numbered streets running east–west start two blocks north ofObserver Highwaywith First Street, with the grid ending close to 16th nearWeehawken Coveand the city line.[96]Castle Point(or Stevens Point[97]),The Projects,Hoboken Terminal, andHudson Teaare distinct enclaves at the city's periphery. The "Northwest" is a name being used for that part of the city as it transforms from its previous industrial use into a residential district.[98][99]
Hoboken'sZIP Codeis 07030[17]and itsarea codeis201.[100]


### Climate
Hoboken's temperatures hover around an average in winter, rising and falling, rather than a consistent pattern with a clear coldest time of year, with minimums occurring in late December and early-mid February, rising and falling repeatedly throughout January.[101]Just like neighboring New York City, the climate is humid subtropical (Cfa).
