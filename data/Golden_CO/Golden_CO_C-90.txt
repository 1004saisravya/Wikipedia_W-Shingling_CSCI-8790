History
[
edit
]


Golden in 1868


The Astor House Museum, the first stone building in Golden, was a boarding and rooming house from 1867 to 1971.


Established during the 
Pike's Peak Gold Rush
, Golden City quickly became a leading economic and political center of the region. Its geographic location made it a center of trade between the gold fields to the west and settlements to the east. Golden City was established on June 16, 1859, along Clear Creek west of Denver. The city is named after 
Thomas L. Golden
. Other important businessmen and prospectors like 
William A.H. Loveland
 and George West were among the first people to settle in Golden.
[
6
]


By the end of 1860, Golden City had been popularly elected the seat of Jefferson County and was capital of the provisional 
Jefferson Territory
. As drafted in the territorial constitution, the capital of the Jefferson Territory was initially proposed to be Golden, then with a population of 700, as a result of its proximity to mountain mining towns, and greater ability to hold a congressional quorum than had Denver.
[
7
]
 Golden City was temporarily removed from the status of territory capital as a result of an act passed on November 5, 1861, by the territorial government. 

Colorado City
, a small town to the south of Denver, became the new temporary territorial capital, but saw only one short event at this location. This status was quickly revoked, however, as on August 4, 1862, the territorial government voted formally to move back to Golden.
[
8
]


While the town lost much of its populace and leading citizenry during the 
Civil War
 for several reasons (ranging from military to economic), Golden City became capital of the federally recognized 
Colorado Territory
 on August 2, 1862, continuing as such until 1867.
[
9
]


Between 1862 and the early 1870s that a fierce railroad competition developed between Denver, ten miles (16 km) to the east, and Golden. By the mid-1860s, Golden held a merely honorific status as the territorial capital, rather than serving as the legitimate source of territorial power. Denver, the increasingly larger and more-developed city, was the focused core of important territorial occasions, with the Governor residing in Denver, and territorial government meetings occurring there as well. The citizens and supporters of Golden realized that a spur from Golden to the new transcontinental railroad, running through 
Cheyenne
, 
Wyoming
, 100 miles (160 km) to the north, was the only possibility for Golden to reemerge as the dominant heart of commerce in the territory. W.A.H. Loveland founded the 
Colorado Central Railroad
 on February 9, 1865, to do just this.
[
6
]


With Golden beginning talk of creating a railroad, prominent Denver residents raced to do the same. In an appeal to the residents of Denver, 
The Rocky Mountain News
,
 which was based in Denver itself
,
 wrote an article imploring the citizens of Denver to vote to fund a railroad; "If we vote $500,000 in bonds to the Denver Pacific railway all is well. If we defeat those bonds, all hope of a railroad for the next two years is gone... Gentlemen of Denver, what will you do? The fate of your city is in your own hands."
[
10
]
 The residents of Denver voted for the bonds, spurring construction of the 
Denver Pacific Railway
. By 1869, the railroad race to Cheyenne was becoming less and less of a race, as the Denver Pacific Railway pulled ahead of the struggling Colorado Central Railroad. Realizing they were going to lose the race to Cheyenne, the Colorado Central began expanding west into mountain communities such as 
Georgetown
, 
Black Hawk
, and 
Central City
, all areas founded on and focused in silver mining.
[
11
]


Golden, having then sidetracked into servicing various close by mountain communities, continued to fall behind the pace set by the Denver railroad, and by 1870, officially lost the race to Cheyenne. However, The Colorado Central Railroad connected directly with Cheyenne seven years later, in 1877, but by that point, the race with Denver had been lost.
[
7
]
 Although Golden's Colorado Central Railroad offered a challenge to Denver's railroad, the better funded Denver Pacific Railway was able to connect to Cheyenne far more quickly than Golden, securing for Denver its long-term status as both capital and prominent city.

The 
Denver Tramway
 at Golden depot, 1909


Golden City became the "
Lowell
 of the West", a regional center of trade and industry that boasted at various times three flour mills, five smelters, the first railroad into the Colorado mountains, the 
Coors Brewery
, brick works, the only paper mill west of 
Missouri
, clay and coal mines, and more. During the 1870s, it became home to three institutions of higher education, the 
Colorado University Schools
, of which the 
Colorado School of Mines
 remains today. Golden was also home to an opera house and seven churches, including Colorado's third (
Methodist
) church, oldest 
Baptist
 church, likely oldest Christian (
Disciples of Christ
) church, and first Swedish immigrant (
Lutheran
) church. The town was home to sizable populations of German, Swiss, Swedish, Italian and Chinese 
immigrants
; five immigrants became mayors of Golden.

Until the early 20th century, Golden maintained a small-town population of around 2,500 people. Several industries faded or were destroyed by tragic events, but others flourished to continue Golden's industrial legacy, including its brewing, brick making, clay mining and porcelain industries.
[

]


Golden became even more connected through 
mass transit
, with two trolley lines extending to 
Denver
, while the movie theater gradually took the place of the opera house for downtown entertainment. Downtown revitalization efforts began in the 1920s with its first streetscape and ornamental lighting project and 
urban renewal
 on its north and east, anchored by new senior high and grade schools. The historic cultural tension between the city's north and south sides gradually eased, and the town successfully endured additional major economic depressions, including the Silver Crash of 1893 and the 
Great Depression
. The School of Mines gained a worldwide academic reputation, Coors rapidly came to the forefront of the national and international brewing and ceramics industries, and the city modernized with a recreation center, paved streets and more.
[

]


After 
World War II
, Golden boomed, rapidly gaining population, size and economy. In 1959, the town nearly tripled in geographic size overnight when it annexed large properties to the south, including the new 
Magic Mountain
 theme park, one of the earliest entertainment attractions of its kind. A number of new subdivisions were built and public infrastructure was modernized, including new buildings for the senior high school, city hall, recreation center, library, museum and central fire and police stations. Also built were new downtown anchors, including 
department stores
 and 
grocery stores
, several new church buildings, new county offices, and the Horizon Plan, which transformed the School of Mines.
[
citation needed
]


The decline in the price of petroleum and near-simultaneous failure of several downtown anchors placed the central business district into recession in the 1980s. The 1990s saw the revitalization of the downtown through various initiatives, including its second streetscaping project in 1992. In 1993, the old Golden High School building was converted into the American Mountaineering Center, making Golden a research and education hub for mountaineering. The Coors Brewery had become the largest single-site brewery in the world, its 
porcelain
 subsidiary among the foremost of its kind, and Golden became home to the 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory
.

Today Golden has a population of over 18,000 and is home to more people and businesses of national and international influence than ever before, yet maintains a small-town historic identity. A Golden mailing address may also represent one of several communities in unincorporated Jefferson County to the north and west of Golden, communities undergoing continual residential development of former farm, ranch and mining land and which possess a considerable population.

Geography
[
edit
]


Golden lies just north of 
I-70
 and west of 
Denver
 at the foot of the 
Rocky Mountains
. It is situated between Lookout Mountain and the two Table Mountains, within a sheltered valley fed by 
Clear Creek
. Clear Creek flows through town from the west, out of its canyon shared by 
US 6
, and exits the valley it carved between 
North Table Mountain
 and 
South Table Mountain
 and in which is located the Coors Brewery.

At the 
2020 United States Census
, the city had a total area of 6,225 acres (25.193 km
2
) including 59 acres (0.240 km
2
) of water.

City streets
[
edit
]


The main part of Golden is laid out upon a historic street grid system running on an approximately northwest–southeast axis, aligned with Clear Creek upon which the heart of the city was established. Most of these are paved streets with a total 66-foot (20 m) right of way, including area for sidewalks which in older areas are often separated by a landscaped strip from the street featuring beautiful and historic trees. The only historic street in the grid not named as a "street" is the main thoroughfare, Washington Avenue, an 80-foot (24 m) right of way featuring a downtown care streetscape with trees, planters, brick, flagstone and ornamental street lights. Golden's streets are generally numbered on the east–west streets, and named on the north–south streets, and are named after pioneers, American Indian tribes and trees. The streets of the southeasterly part of town are aligned with the Denver metropolitan street grid, which are aligned directly with the true directions of the compass, and they share the names of the Denver grid. Outlying subdivisions of Golden consist of their own, often curvilinear street systems, with varying degrees of connection to the rest of the city. Golden has several main thoroughfare street connections to the east which date to the Gold Rush times, including West 44th Avenue, West 32nd Avenue and South Golden Road.



Highways
[
edit
]


One of the numerous highway tunnels through the rugged terrain between 
Idaho Springs
 and Golden


Since its beginning, Golden has been at a crossroads of major Colorado thoroughfares. Today 
Interstate 70
 (I-70) runs through the southern part of the city, which connects to the northern terminus of 
SH 470
 which runs to the south. 
U.S. Highway 6
 (US 6), which turns into 6th Avenue, is a historic thoroughfare (built in 1950) which runs east–west through the southern part of the city then curves northward through the western part of Golden, ultimately arriving at the mouth of Clear Creek Canyon. 
State Highway 93
 (SH 93), which traces its roots to the 1860s, continues north through the western part of the city from the canyon and northward towards 
Boulder
. 
SH 58
, which turns into 
Golden Freeway
, bisects Golden on an east–west route between 6th and 7th Streets, and ultimately joins to go up Clear Creek Canyon. West 
Colfax Avenue
, the historic 
US 40
, runs on an approximately northeast–southwest route through the southern end of the city and turns westward up Mt. Vernon Canyon and parallels I-70.



Mass transportation
[
edit
]


Golden is part of the network of the 
Regional Transportation District
 which provides bus and light rail service throughout the Denver metropolitan area. Its bus routes 16, 16L, and GS connect Golden with other points of the Denver metropolitan area and Boulder. The 
West Corridor (W line)
 of the 
FasTracks
 
light rail
 line, which parallels 6th Avenue into Golden to its terminal at the Jefferson County Government Center, opened to the public on April 26, 2013. This is a modern version of the historic trolley line that Golden interests spearheaded in the 1890s.
[
citation needed
]
 At the same time the W Line opened, a Community Call-n-Ride bus launched in Golden, offering flexible service along with regular stops within the city itself. The new bus system was designed to complement the light rail, extending the transit service into the whole community, including the downtown corridor. Although passengers are no longer served by heavy rail, Golden continues to be served by 
railroad
 transportation for cargo, as it has been continuously since 1870. These lines are owned by the 
BNSF
 railroad and serve business interests in the northeastern end of the city. Within the Coors Brewery grounds it becomes the brewery's own in-house railroad.



Airports
[
edit
]


The closest airport to Golden is nearby 
Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport
, a 
general aviation
 air transport facility located in northeastern Jefferson County. Passenger traffic generally uses 
Denver International Airport
