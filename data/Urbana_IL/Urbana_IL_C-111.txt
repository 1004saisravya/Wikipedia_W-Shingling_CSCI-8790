'''Urbana''' ({{IPAc-en|ɜr|ˈ|b|æ|n|ə}} {{Respell|ur|BAN|ə}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Champaign County, Illinois]], United States.<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712220218/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=2012-07-12 }}</ref> As of the 2020 census, Urbana had a population of 38,336. It is a principal city of the [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area]], which had 236,000 residents in 2020.

Urbana is notable for sharing the main campus of the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] with its twin city of [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]].

==History==
The Urbana area was first settled by Europeans in 1822,<ref name=history>{{Cite web |url=http://history.rays-place.com/il/cham-urbanacity.htm |title=History of the City of Urbana |access-date=2007-10-13 }}{{dead link|date=April 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> when it was called "Big Grove".<ref name=story>McGinty, Alice.

Webber and 20 acres by M.&nbsp;W. Busey, considered to be the city's founder, and the name "Urbana" was adopted<ref name=history /> after [[Urbana, Ohio]], the hometown of State Senator John W. Vance, who authored the Enabling Act creating Champaign County.<ref>{{Cite web|title=John W. Vance: The "Father of Champaign County" {{!}} Urbana Free Library|url=https://urbanafreelibrary.org/blogs/2017/03/17/john-w-vance-%E2%80%9Cfather-champaign-county%E2%80%9D|access-date=2022-02-09|website=urbanafreelibrary.org}}</ref> The creation of the new town was celebrated for the first time on July 4, 1833.<ref name=story />

Stores began opening in 1834. The first mills were founded in {{Circa|1838}}-50. The town's first church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the parsonage, was built in 1840 by the Rev. A. Bradshaw, with the Baptist Church following in 1855. The Presbyterian Church was founded in 1856.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://firstpresurbana.org/about-us/who-we-are/our-history/|title=Our History|date=December 22, 2018}}</ref> The city's first school was built in 1854.<ref name=history />

Urbana suffered a setback when the [[Chicago]] branch of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], which had been expected to pass through town, was instead laid down two miles west, where the land was flatter. The town of West Urbana grew up around the train depot built there in 1854, and in 1861 its name was changed to [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]. The competition between the two cities provoked Urbana to tear down the ten-year-old County Courthouse and replace it with a much larger and fancier structure, to ensure that the county seat would remain in Urbana.<ref name=story />

Champaign-Urbana was selected as the site for a new state agricultural school, thanks to the efforts of Clark Griggs. Illinois Industrial University, which would evolve into the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], opened in 1868 with 77 students.<ref name=story />

A number of efforts to merge Urbana and Champaign have failed at the polls.<ref name=story />

On October 9, 1871, a fire burned much of downtown Urbana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://urbanabusiness.com/explore/history/ |title=History of Urbana - Urbana Business AssociationUrbana Business Association |access-date=2014-10-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026232709/http://urbanabusiness.com/explore/history/ |archive-date=2014-10-26 }}</ref> Children playing with matches started the fire.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iafflocal1147.org/?zone=%2Funionactive%2Fview_article.cfm&HomeID=74831&page=About20Us |title=IAFF Local 1147 |access-date=2022-06-30 |archive-date=2012-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154714/http://www.iafflocal1147.org/?zone=%2Funionactive%2Fview_article.cfm&HomeID=74831&page=About20Us |url-status=dead }}</ref> (It is unrelated to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] that started the day before, though both fires occurred during severe drought and were spread by high winds.)

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Urbana has a total area of {{convert|11.90|sqmi|km2|2}}, of which {{convert|11.83|sqmi|km2|2}} (or 99.40%) is land and {{convert|0.07|sqmi|km2|2}} (or 0.60%) is water.<ref name="gaz2021">{{Cite web   |title=Gazetteer Files |url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |access-date=2022-06-29 |website=Census.gov}}</ref>

Urbana borders the city of [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]. The main campus of the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] is situated on this border. Together, these two cities are often referred to as ''Urbana-Champaign'' (the designation used by the university) or ''Champaign-Urbana'' (the more common usage, due to the larger size of Champaign). With the nearby village of [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]] they form the [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area]].

===Candlestick Lane===

Candlestick Lane is the name of a neighborhood in eastern Urbana.  This neighborhood consists of Grant Place and adjacent properties on Fairlawn and Eastern Drives.  It is called Candlestick Lane because every year the residents decorate their yards for Christmas with a lot of lights and figures.  The tradition began in 1961 (maybe 1960) as a house-decorating contest sponsored by the Illinois Power Company.  The neighborhood used its prize money to purchase electric candlesticks for each home.  The City of Urbana installs special red and green street signs, reading "Candlestick Lane" and "Grant Place" during the Holiday season. The lights are turned on from around 5:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. from the third Saturday in December through New Years Day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/blogs/central_illinois_gazette/2006/12/14/candlestick_lane_debut|title="Candlestick Lane Debut" by Tom Kacich, The News-Gazette Weblog}}</ref>

The original building was built in the Tudor Revival style. A convention center was added in the 1970s in the Bavarian style. While being forced to close twice between 1990 and 2009, the hotel was purchased by a private developer in 2010 and underwent major rehabilitation. The hotel opened under new management and with a new name, Urbana Landmark Hotel, on December 1, 2012, but it closed in July 2015<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-gazette.com/news/hotel-back-on-market/article_169b1d36-3d7d-56b3-ac7a-d2cd7036072a.html|title=Hotel back on market|first=Tom|last=Kacich|website=The News-Gazette}}</ref> and sold January 2020 for redevelopment as a Hilton Tapestry hotel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-gazette.com/business/economy/developer-completes-purchase-of-urbanas-landmark-hotel/article_5ab4b754-41fd-11ea-86e6-5f5e7fbbe34b.html|title=Developer completes purchase of Urbana's Landmark Hotel|first=Ben|last=Zigterman|website=The News-Gazette}}</ref>

Carle Park,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanaparks.org/parks/carle-park/|title=Carle Park - General Gallery - Photo Galleries &#124; Urbana Park District|website=www.urbanaparks.org}}</ref>  established in 1909, is located at Indiana and Garfield, just west of Urbana High School in central Urbana. Measuring {{convert|8.3|acre|m2}}, it contains a statue entitled ''[[Lincoln the Lawyer]]'' by [[Lorado Taft]] and more than 50 well-established trees that are part of the Hickman Tree Walk. The Lincoln statue was previously sited in front of the Urbana Lincoln Hotel, but was moved after only a few months.

Meadowbrook Park<ref>[http://www.urbanaparks.org/facilities/16.html "Meadowbrook Park"]. urbanaparks.org.</ref> is located southeast of the Race Street and Windsor Road intersection. The park covers {{convert|130|acre|km2}}, including 80 of recreated Illinois [[tallgrass prairie]]. Around the prairie restoration center of the park loops three miles of wide concrete path suitable for walking, running, and bicycling. In addition, for an off the beaten path experience, the park offers two miles of unpaved trails which wind through the prairie grass.

The "Art in the Park",<ref>[http://urbanaillinois.us/artinthepark Art in the Park]</ref> just north of the Urbana City Hall (400 S. Vine St.) dedicated October 2012, took 22 years of struggle and efforts of three mayors. The environmental and sculptural artists/curator of the park, John David Mooney designed the plantings, walkways, a 12-foot high fountain sculpture (Falling Leaf), and a 33-foot high light sculpture (Spirit Tree). The Spirit Tree specifically gives new meaning to Urbana's designation as a "Tree City" and to trees as landmarks or beacons. Mooney, an internationally acclaimed artist, is a native to Champaign-Urbana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mooneyfoundation.org/|title=Home|website=jdmf}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:CUMTD Bus 2105.jpg|thumb|A [[Champaign–Urbana Mass Transit District]] (MTD) bus]]
Downtown Urbana is located southwest of the intersection of its two busiest streets: [[U.S. Route 150|U.S. 150]] (University Avenue) and [[U.S. Route 45|U.S. 45]] (Vine Street-Cunningham Avenue).

Most of Urbana lies south of [[Interstate 74 in Illinois|I-74]]. There are three exits (from west to east): Lincoln (I-74 milepost 183), Cunningham (184) and University (185). The Lincoln exit is closest to the University of Illinois, while the Cunningham exit goes to downtown Urbana. The University exit goes to downtown Urbana as well as [[Illinois Route 130]] to [[Philo, Illinois|Philo]].

Local bus service is primarily provided by the [[Champaign–Urbana Mass Transit District]], although limited service is available from [[Champaign County Area Rural Transit System]] and [[Danville Mass Transit]], operators which primarily serve [[Rantoul, Illinois|Rantoul]] and [[Danville, Illinois|Danville]] respectively.

The [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] operates an east to west line through Urbana. The NS line connects industries in eastern Urbana to the Norfolk Southern main line at [[Mansfield, Illinois]], west of Champaign. The line now operated by Norfolk Southern is the former [[Peoria & Eastern Railway]], later operated as part of the Big Four ([[Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]]), [[New York Central]], [[Penn Central Transportation|Penn Central]], and [[Conrail]] systems, being sold by Conrail to Norfolk Southern in 1996. Construction of the line was begun by the Danville, Urbana, Bloomington and Pekin Railroad. This short-lived entity became part of the [[Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway]] before the railroad was completed. A branch line of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (formerly the Wabash Railroad) used to connect Urbana with the main line from Danville to Decatur at [[Sidney, Illinois]], but this was first rerouted and later closed in the early 1990s.

[[University of Illinois Willard Airport]] serves the city.

==In popular culture==
In the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Urbana was named as the location where the [[HAL 9000]] computer of the ill-fated Discovery Mission to [[Jupiter]] was programmed. The 1959 [[comedy]] ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' also mentions Urbana. Near the beginning of this film, [[Jack Lemmon]]'s character, an unemployed bass player, suggests to [[Tony Curtis]], a saxophone player, that the two visit Urbana to play at the University of Illinois. Instead, the two musicians elected to join a women's band in Florida. Urbana provides the setting for [[Bert I. Gordon]]'s 1957 [[science fiction]] film, ''[[Beginning of the End (film)|Beginning of the End]]''. Parodied on the television program, ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', this movie features the unintentional creation of dangerous, giant grasshoppers as a result of agricultural research gone awry.

[[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] English Professor and [[National Book Award]] winner [[Richard Powers]] set his novel ''[[Galatea 2.2]]'' at the multidisciplinary [[The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology|Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology]]. Spanish writer [[Javier Cercas]] uses Urbana as the geographical background for two of his novels, "La velocidad de la luz" (2005) and "El inquilino" (1989).

==Sister cities==
[[File:Channing-Murray Foundation Unitarian Universalist Chapel Urbana Illinois.jpg|thumb|The [[Channing-Murray Foundation]] is housed in the former Unitarian Church of Urbana on the University of Illinois campus]]
Urbana is twinned with three sister cities:
* [[Zomba, Malawi]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Urbana's Sister City Program--Zomba, Malawi|url=http://urbanaillinois.us/UrbanaSisterCities|access-date= September 17, 2011}}</ref>
* [[Haizhu District|Haizhu]], [[Guangzhou]], China
* [[Thionville]], France

The city of Urbana has been awarded a major grant from Sister Cities International to undertake a trilateral pilot project involving Urbana, Zomba, Malawi, and the [[Haizhu District|Haizhu District, China]]. The one-year [[Sister Cities International|Sino-African Initiative]] grant is for up to $100,000 and will involve a collaborative effort to improve the municipal waste disposal system in Zomba, a city of 88,000 in southeast Africa. Urbana has had a Sister City relationship with Zomba since 2008, another relationship with Haizhu District, [[Guangzhou|Guangzhou City]], China since 2012, and added a third sister city charter with Thionville, France in 2014. Urbana is one of only three cities in the United States to be awarded a Sino-African grant. The others are Denver and an Asheville/Raleigh, N.C., joint team application.
