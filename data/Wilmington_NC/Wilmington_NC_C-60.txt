Wilmington
 is a 
port city
 in 
New Hanover County
, in southeastern 
North Carolina
, United States; it is also the 
county seat
. With a population of 115,451 (as of the 
2020 census
),
[
7
]
 it is also the 
eighth-most populous city in the state
 and the principal city of the 
Wilmington, NC, Metropolitan Statistical Area
, which includes New Hanover, 
Brunswick
, and 
Pender
 counties.
[
8
]
 As of 2023, its 
metropolitan statistical area
 had an estimated population of 467,337.
[
6
]


Wilmington's residential area lies between the 
Cape Fear River
 and the 
Atlantic Ocean
. The city's downtown includes a 1.75-mile (2.82 km) riverwalk,
[
9
]
 developed as a tourist attraction in the late 20th century. The riverfront was ranked as the "Best American Riverfront" by readers of 
USA Today
 in 2014,
[
10
]
 and in 2008, 
the National Trust for Historic Preservation
 named Wilmington one of its “Dozen Distinctive Destinations.”
[
11
]
 There are also four beach communities within a half-hour's drive of the downtown area: 
Fort Fisher
, 
Wrightsville Beach
, 
Carolina Beach
, and 
Kure Beach
. 

The city is home to the 
University of North Carolina Wilmington
 (UNCW), which offers a wide variety of programs for undergraduates, graduate students, and adult learners, in addition to cultural and sports events open to the community.

Toward the end of the 19th century, when Wilmington was majority-black, racially integrated, prosperous – and the largest city in North Carolina – the city suffered what became known as the 
Wilmington massacre of 1898
: 
white supremacists
 launched a 
coup
 that overthrew the legitimately elected local 
Fusionist
 government.
[
13
]
 They killed a number of people (estimates range from 60 to more than 300), ran both black and white opposition leaders out of the city,
[
13
]
 destroyed black citizens’ property and businesses that had been built up since the end of the 
Civil War
, including the city's only black-owned newspaper.
[
14
]
 This coincided with broader efforts at disenfranchisement on the state level: North Carolina had 125,000 registered black voters in 1896, and only 6,000 by 1902.
[
15
]
 By 1910, 
Charlotte
 overtook Wilmington as North Carolina's largest city.

In 2003, the city was designated by the U.S. Congress as a "Coast Guard City", one of 29 cities that currently bear that designation.
[
16
]
 It was the home port for the 
USCGC 
Diligence
, a 
United States Coast Guard
 
medium-endurance cutter
, until 2020.
[
17
]
[
18
]
 On September 2, 2020, then-President 
Donald Trump
 officially declared Wilmington as the first 
World War II Heritage City
 in the country. The World War II battleship 
USS 
North Carolina
, now a war memorial, is moored across from the downtown port area, and is open to the public for tours.
[
19
]
 Other attractions include the 
Cape Fear Museum of History and Science
 and the Children's Museum of Wilmington.
[

Wilmington is also the home of 
Cinespace Wilmington
,
[

 the largest domestic television and movie production facility outside California.
[
24
]
 Dream Stage 10, the facility's newest sound stage, is the third-largest in the United States. It houses the largest special-effects water tank in North America.
[
25
]
 After the studio complex's opening in 1984, Wilmington became a major center of American film and television production. 
Numerous movies and television series
—in a range of genres—have been filmed/produced in or near the city, including

History
[

Timeline of Wilmington, North Carolina


Colonial beginnings
[
edit
]


Mitchell-Anderson House (built 1738)


The city was founded in the 1730s. After going through a series of different names (New Carthage, New London, Newton), its name became Wilmington in 1740,
[
30
]
 named after 
Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington
.
[
30
]


The area along the river had been inhabited by various successive cultures of 
indigenous peoples
 for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, historic Native Americans were members of tribes belonging to the 
Eastern Siouan
 family.
[
31
]


In the early 16th century, Italian explorer 
Giovanni da Verrazzano
, commissioned by the king of France with a French crew, was reportedly the first European to see this area, including the city's present site. The first permanent colonial settlement in the area was established in the 1720s by 
European settlers
.
[
31
]
 In September 1732, a community was founded on land owned by John Watson on the 
Cape Fear River
, at the confluence of its northwest and northeast branches.
[
32
]
 The settlement, founded by the first royal governor, 
George Burrington
, was called New Carthage, and then New Liverpool; it gradually took on the name New Town or Newton.
[
33
]
 
Governor Gabriel Johnston
 soon after established his government there for the 
North Carolina colony
. In 1739 or 1740, the town was incorporated with a new name, Wilmington, in honor of 
Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington
.
[
34
]


Some early settlers of Wilmington came from the 
Albemarle
 and 
Pamlico
 regions, as well as from the colonies of 
Virginia
 and 
South Carolina
, but most new settlers migrated from the 
northern colonies
, the 
West Indies
, and 
Northern Europe
.
[
35
]
 Many of the early settlers were 
indentured servants
 from Northern Europe. As the indentured servants gained their freedom and fewer could be persuaded to travel to North America because of improving conditions back home, the settlers imported an increasing number of 
slaves
 to satisfy the labor demand.
[
33
]
 By 1767, African slaves accounted for more than 62% of the population of the Lower Cape Fear region.
[
36
]
 Many worked in the port as laborers, and some in ship-related trades.

Naval stores
 and lumber fueled the region's economy, both before and after the 
American Revolution
. During the Revolutionary War, the British maintained a garrison at 
Fort Johnston
 near Wilmington.

Revolutionary era

Bellamy Mansion

Due to Wilmington's commercial importance as a major port, it had a critical role in opposition to the British in the years leading up to the revolution. The city had outspoken political leaders who influenced and led the resistance movement in North Carolina. The foremost of these was Wilmington resident 
Cornelius Harnett
, who was serving in the 
General Assembly
 at the time, and where he rallied opposition to the 
Sugar Act
 in 1764. When the 
British Parliament
 passed the 
Stamp Act
 the following year, designed to raise revenue for 
the Crown
 with a kind of tax on shipping, Wilmington was the site of an elaborate demonstration against it.
[
38
]


On October 19, 1765, several hundred townspeople gathered in protest of the new law, burned an effigy of one town resident who favored the act, and toasted to "Liberty, Property, and No Stamp Duty." On October 31, another crowd gathered in a symbolic funeral of "Liberty". Before the effigy was buried, though, Liberty was found to have a pulse, and celebration ensued.
[

William Houston of 
Duplin County
 was appointed stamp receiver for Cape Fear. When Houston visited Wilmington on business, still unaware of his appointment, he recounted,



"The Inhabitants immediately assembled about me & demanded a Categorical Answer whether I intended to put the Act relating [to] the Stamps in force. The Town Bell was rung[,] Drums [were] beating, Colours [were] flying and [a] great concourse of People [were] gathered together." For the sake of his own life, and "to quiet the Minds of the inraged  [
sic
] and furious Mobb...," Houston resigned his position at the courthouse.
[
39
]
[
41
]


Governor 
William Tryon
 made attempts to mitigate the opposition, to no avail. On November 18, 1765, he pleaded his case directly to prominent residents of the area. They said the law restricted their rights. When the stamps arrived on November 28 on 
HMS 
Diligence
,
 Tryon ordered them to be kept on board. Shipping on the Cape Fear River was stopped, as were the functions of the courts.
[
39
]


Tryon, after having received his official commission as governor (a position he had assumed only after the death of 
Arthur Dobbs
), was brought to Wilmington by 
Captain Constantine Phipps
 on a barge from the 
Diligence
, and "was received cordially by the gentlemen of the borough." He was greeted with the firing of seventeen pieces of 
artillery
, and the New Hanover County Regiment of the North Carolina 
militia
, who had lined the streets. This "warm welcome" was spoiled, however, after a dispute arose between Captain Phipps and captains of ships in the harbor regarding the display of their colors. The townspeople became infuriated with Phipps and threats were made against both sides. After Tryon harangued them for their actions, the townspeople gathered around the barrels of punch and 
ox
 he had brought as refreshments. The barrels were broken open, letting the punch spill into the streets; they threw the head of the ox into the 
pillory
, and gave its body to the enslaved population. Because of the unrest, Tryon moved his seat of government to 
New Bern
 instead of Wilmington.
[
33
]
[
42
]


On February 18, 1766, two merchant ships arrived without stamped papers at 
Brunswick Town
. Each ship provided signed statements from the collectors at their respective ports of origin that no were stamps available, but Captain Jacob Lobb of the British cruiser 
Viper
 seized the vessels. In response, numerous residents from southern counties met in Wilmington. The group organized as the 
Sons of Liberty
 and pledged to block implementation of the Stamp Act. The following day, as many as a thousand men, including the mayor and aldermen of Wilmington, were led by Cornelius Harnett to Brunswick to confront Tryon. The governor was unyielding, but a mob retrieved the seized ships. They forced royal customs officers and public officials in the region to swear never to issue stamped paper.
[
43
]
 The Westminster Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in March 1766.



Antebellum period
[

In the 1830s, citizens of Wilmington became eager to take advantage of 
railroad transportation
. At this time, the shipping tonnage registered at Wilmington was 9,035.
[
44
]
  Plans were developed to build a railroad line from the capital, 
Raleigh
, to Wilmington. When Raleigh citizens declined to subscribe in sufficient number to 
stock
 to raise money for the project, organizers changed the terminus to 
Weldon
. When the railroad line was completed in 1840, it was the longest single line of 
railroad track
 in the world. The railroad also controlled a fleet of steamboats that ran between Wilmington and 
Charleston
; these were used both for passenger travel and freight. Regular boat lines served 
Fayetteville
, and packet lines traveled to northern ports. The city was a main stopover point, contributing greatly to its commerce.
[
33
]


By mid-century, the churchyard of 
St. James Episcopal Church
 and other town cemeteries had become filled with graves. On November 16, 1853, a group of citizens, organized as "the Proprietors of the Wilmington Cemetery", was formed to develop a new 
cemetery
. Sixty-five acres of land around Burnt Mill Creek were chosen as the site for what would be called 
Oakdale Cemetery
. It was the first rural cemetery in North Carolina. The cemetery's first interment, on February 6, 1855, was six-year-old Annie deRosset.
[
45
]
 Many remains from St. James churchyard were relocated to the new cemetery.

The Wilmington Gas Light Company was established in 1854. Soon after, streetlights were powered by gas made from lightwood and 
rosin
, replacing the old street oil lamps. On December 27, 1855, the first cornerstone was laid, and construction began on a new city hall. A grant from the Thalian Association funded the attached opera house, named Thalian Hall. In 1857, the city opened its first public school, named the Union Free School, on 6th Street between Nun and Church Streets, serving White students.
[
46
]


Wilmington had a Black majority population before the Civil War.
[
47
]
 While most were slaves, the city had a significant community of 
free people of color
, who developed businesses and trades. For a period up to 
Nat Turner
's rebellion, they had been allowed to vote, carry arms, and serve in the militia. Fears after the rebellion resulted in the state legislature passing laws to restrict the rights of free Blacks.



Civil War

 has markers dating to the

 and the

During the 
Civil War
, the port was the major base for 
Confederate and privately owned blockade runners
, which delivered badly needed supplies from England. The Union mounted a blockade to reduce the goods received by the South. The city was captured by Union forces in the 
Battle of Wilmington
 in February 1865, about one month after the fall of 
Fort Fisher
 had closed the port. Wilmington was the last Confederate port to be captured.
[
48
]
 As nearly all the military action took place some distance from the city, numerous 
antebellum
 houses and other buildings survived the war years.
[
49
]


In mid-August of 1862, Wilmington was devastated by a deadly outbreak of 
yellow fever
. This fever outbreak was brought about by a blockade runner named 
Kate.
 Sources suggest that the runner had crew members who were sick before the ship landed, but Dr. W.T. Wragg would later write an article in the 
New York Journal of Medicine
 that there were at least five cases in the city before the ship arrived. Dr. Wragg treated many of the yellow fever victims during the outbreak and claimed that the dirtiness of the city and the fumes of the dirty water left by heavy rains caused the disease. By the end of the outbreak at least 1,500 and perhaps as many as 2,000, contracted yellow fever. Of those, between 650 and 800 died, a mortality rate approximately 40 percent  
Walter Reed
 would later discover in 1900 that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, so Wilmington's outbreak had to be introduced by a third party and spread by mosquitoes in the city.

Reconstruction era and 1898 insurrection

Main article: 
Wilmington Insurrection of 1898


Wilmington 
c.
 1898


During the 
Reconstruction era
, former free Blacks and newly emancipated 
freedmen
 built a community in the city. About 55% of its residents were Black people.
[
52
]
[
53
]
 At the time, Wilmington was the largest city and the economic capital of the state.

Three of the city's aldermen were Black. Black people were also in positions of justice of the peace, deputy clerk of court, street superintendent, coroners, policemen, mail clerks, and mail carriers.
[
54
]


At the time, Black people accounted for over 30% of Wilmington's skilled craftsmen, such as mechanics, carpenters, jewelers, watchmakers, painters, plasterers, plumbers, stevedores, blacksmiths, masons, and wheelwrights. In addition, they owned 10 of the city's 11 restaurants and were 90% of the city's 22 barbers. The city had more Black bootmakers/shoemakers than White ones, and half of the city's tailors were Black. Lastly, two brothers, 
Alexander
 and Frank Manly, owned the 
Wilmington Daily Record
, one of the few Black-owned newspapers in the state, which was reported to be the only one in the country.
[
55
]


In the 1890s, a coalition of Republicans and 
Populists
 had gained state and federal offices. The Democrats were determined to reassert their control. Violence increased around elections in this period, as armed White 
paramilitary
 insurgents, known as 
Red Shirts
, worked to suppress Black and 
Republican
 voting. White Democrats regained control of the state legislature and sought to impose 
white supremacy
, but some Blacks continued to be elected to local offices.
[
56
]


The 
Wilmington Insurrection of 1898
 (also known as the Wilmington Race Riot) occurred as a result of the racially charged political conflict that had occurred in the decades after the Civil War and efforts by White Democrats to re-establish white supremacy and overturn Black voting. In 1898, a cadre of White Democrats, professionals, and businessmen planned to overthrow the city government if their candidates were not elected. Two days after the election, in which a White Republican was elected mayor and both White and Black aldermen were elected, more than 1500 White men (led by Democrat 
Alfred M. Waddell
, an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in 1896) attacked and burned the only Black-owned daily newspaper in the state and ran off the new officers. They overthrew the legitimately elected municipal government. Waddell and his men forced the elected Republican city officials to resign at gunpoint and replaced them with men selected by leading White Democrats. Waddell was elected mayor by the newly seated board of aldermen that day. Prominent Black Americans and White Republicans were banished from the city in the following days.
[
47
]
 This is the only such 
coup d'état
 
in United States history.
[
47
]
[
57
]


Whites attacked and killed an estimated 10–100 Blacks; no Whites died in the violence. As a result of the attacks, more than 2100 Blacks permanently left the city, leaving a hole among its professional and middle classes. The demographic change was so large that the city became majority White, rather than the majority Black it was before the coup.
[
47
]


Following these events, the North Carolina legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to 
voter registration
, imposing requirements for 
poll taxes
 and 
literacy tests
 that effectively 
disfranchised
 most Black voters, following the example of Mississippi. Blacks were essentially excluded from the political system until after the enactment of the federal 
Voting Rights Act of 1965
.

Wilmington is home to the Bijou Theater, which began as a tent in 1904 and progressed to a permanent structure in 1906.  It operated until 1956, making it the oldest movie theater in the state and one of the oldest, continuously running theaters in the country.
[
58

  In 1910, 
Charlotte
 passed Wilmington to become North Carolina's largest city.
[
59

 In the mid-20th century, efforts to preserve many historic building began. Due to this, many historic buildings were listed as 
National Register of Historic Places
.
[

 Since the 1980s, Wilmington has remained the largest film and television production area in the state;
[

During 
World War II
, Wilmington was the home of the 
North Carolina Shipbuilding Company
. The shipyard was created as part of the U.S. government's 
Emergency Shipbuilding Program
. Workers built 243 ships in Wilmington during the five years the company operated.
[

Three 
prisoner-of-war
 (POW) camps operated in the city from February 1944 through April 1946. At their peak, the camps held 550 
German
 prisoners. The first camp was located on the corner of Shipyard Boulevard and Carolina Beach Road; it was moved downtown to Ann Street, between 8th and 10th Avenues, when it outgrew the original location. A smaller contingent of prisoners was assigned to a third site, working in the officers' mess and doing groundskeeping at Bluethenthal Army Air Base, which is now 
Wilmington International Airport
.

21st century
[

During the 1990s, and all the way to the late-2000s, Wilmington began to grow rapidly, partially due to the film industry and the completion of I-40.
[

 The city successfully annexed the areas of 
Seagate
 in 1998 and 
Masonboro
 in 2000. The annexation of 
Monkey Junction
 was stopped in 2012 by the 
North Carolina House of Representatives
 after local backlash.

 In 2017, a chemical compound called 
GenX
, discharged by a 
Chemours
 plant near 
Fayetteville, North Carolina

Cape Fear River
; a major 
water source
 for the region. It was also revealed that the same plant had been discharging the chemical compound since 1980.

"Welcome to Wilmington" sign


Wilmington is the eastern terminus of 
Interstate 40
, an east-west freeway that ends 2,554 miles away at 
Barstow, California
, where it joins I-15, the gateway to Southern California. This road passes through many major cities and state capitals along the way.

According to the 
United States Census Bureau
, the city has a total area of 52.97 square miles (137.2 km
2
), of which 51.41 square miles (133.2 km
2
) is land and 1.56 square miles (4.0 km
2
) (2.95%) is water.

Climate
[
edit
]


Wilmington has a 
humid subtropical climate
 (
Köppen
 
Cfa
), with these characteristics:



Cypress trees in Greenfield Lake


Winters are generally mild with January highs in the mid-50s °F (~12 °C) and lows in the mid-30s °F (~1 °C). Snowfall does not occur in most years, and when it does, is generally light.


Spring is reasonably lengthy, beginning in late February and lasting to early May. The presence of abundant dense vegetation in the area causes significant pollen dusting in the springtime that tends to turn rooftops and cars yellow.


Summer brings high humidity, with daily high temperatures usually ranging from the upper 80s to lower 90s °F (31–34 °C), and daily low temperatures usually from 70 to 75 °F (~22 °C). 
Heat indices
 can easily break the 100 °F (38 °C) mark, though the actual temperature does not in most years. Due to the proximity of warm Atlantic Ocean waters and prevailing tropical-system tracks, the Wilmington area is subject to hurricane or tropical storm activity, mostly from August to early October, with an average frequency of once every seven years.

Pharmaceutical Product Development
 and current tallest building in Wilmington at 228 feet (69 m). (The building was then bought by 
Thermo Fisher Scientific
. In 2023, it was bought by the City of Wilmington and renamed "Skyline Center". It is now the main building for city government operations.

Cable news station 
News 14 Carolina
 also maintains its coastal bureau in Wilmington.

On September 8, 2008, at noon, WWAY, WECT, WSFX, WILM-LP and W51CW all turned off their analog signals, making Wilmington the first market in the nation to go digital-only as part of a test by the 
Federal Communications Commission
 (FCC) to iron out transition and reception concerns before the 
nationwide shutoff
. Wilmington was chosen as the test market because the area's digital channel positions will remain unchanged after the transition.
[
151
]
 As the area's official conduit of emergency information, WUNJ did not participate in the early analog switchoff, and kept their analog signal on until the national 
digital switchover
 date of June 12, 2009.
[
152
]
 W47CK did not participate due to its low-power status; FCC rules currently exempt low-powered stations from the 2009 analog shutdown.
[
153
]
 WILM-LP and W51CW chose to participate, even though they are exempt as LPTV stations.
[
154
]


Despite 
Tropical Storm Hanna
 making landfall southwest of Wilmington two days before (September 6), the switchover continued as scheduled. The ceremony was marked by governmental and television representatives flipping a large switch (marked with the slogan "First in Flight, First in Digital") from analog to digital.
