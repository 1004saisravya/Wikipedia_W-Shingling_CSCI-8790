Named for the abundant ash trees lining theSan Joaquin River, Fresno was founded in 1872 as a railway station of theCentral Pacific Railroadbefore it wasincorporatedin 1885. It has since become an economic hub of Fresno County and the San Joaquin Valley, with much of the surrounding areas in theMetropolitan Fresnoregion predominantly tied to large-scale agricultural production. Fresno is near the geographic center of California, approximately 220 miles (350 km) north ofLos Angeles, 170 miles (270 km) south of the state capital,Sacramento, and 185 miles (300 km) southeast ofSan Francisco.Yosemite National Parkis about 60 miles (100 km) to the north,Kings Canyon National Park60 miles (100 km) to the east, andSequoia National Park75 miles (120 km) to the southeast.
Fresno is alsothe fourth-largest majority-Hispanic cityin the United States with 50.5% of its population being Hispanic in 2020.[13]


### History
The original inhabitants of theSan Joaquin Valleyregion were theYokuts peopleandMiwok people, who engaged in trading with other Californian tribes of Native Americans including coastal peoples such as theChumashof the Central California coast, with whom they are thought to have traded plant and animal products.
The first European to enter the San Joaquin Valley wasPedro Fagesin 1772.[14]The county of Fresno was formed in 1856 after theCalifornia Gold Rushand was named for the abundant ash trees (Spanish: fresno) lining theSan Joaquin River.
The San Joaquin River flooded on December 24, 1867, inundatingMillerton. Some residents rebuilt, others moved. Flooding also destroyed the town of Scottsburg on the nearbyKings Riverthat winter. Rebuilt on higher ground, Scottsburg was renamed Centerville.[15]
In 1867, Anthony Easterby purchased land bounded by the present Chestnut, Belmont, Clovis and California avenues, that today is called theSunnyside district. Unable to grow wheat for lack of water, he hired sheep man Moses Church in 1870 to create an irrigation system.[16]Building new canals and purchasing existing ditches, Church then formed the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company, a predecessor of the Fresno Irrigation District.
In 1872, theCentral Pacific Railroadestablished a station near Easterby's—by now a hugely productive wheat farm—for its newSouthern Pacificline. Soon there was a store near the station and the store grew into the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno. At that time, Mariposa street was the main artery, a rough dusty or muddy depression.[17]Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885. In 1903, the faltering San Joaquin Power Company was renamed the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation and included the Fresno City Water Company and the Fresno City Railway.[18]By 1931 the railway, now known as theFresno Traction Company, operated 47streetcarsover 49 miles (79 km) of track.[19]
In 1865,William Helmbrought his sheep to Fresno county, which was then a vast space of open land.[20]By 1877, Helm made Fresno his home with a five-acre tract of land at the corner of Fresno and R streets. Helm was the largest individualsheep growerin Fresno County.[21]
Two years after the station was established, county residents voted to move the county seat from Millerton to Fresno. When theFriant Damwas completed in 1944, the site of Millerton became inundated by the waters ofMillerton Lake. In extreme droughts, when the reservoir shrinks, ruins of the original county seat can still be observed.
In the nineteenth century, with so much wooden construction and in the absence of sophisticated firefighting resources, fires often ravaged American frontier towns. The greatest of Fresno's early-day fires, in 1882, destroyed an entire block of the city. Another devastating blaze struck in 1883.
In 1909, Fresno's first and oldestsynagogue,Temple Beth Israel, was founded.
Fresno entered the ranks of the 100 most populous cities in the United States in 1960 with a population of 134,000. Thirty years later, in the 1990 census, it moved up to 47th place with 354,000, and in the census of 2000, it achieved 37th place with 428,000.[22]
TheFresno Municipal Sanitary Landfillwas the first modernlandfillin the United States, and incorporated several important innovations to waste disposal, including trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of trash with dirt. It was opened in 1937 and closed in 1987. It is aNational Historic Landmarkas well as aSuperfundsite.[23]
Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, andChinatown. In 1940, theCensus Bureaureported Fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian.[24]Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today few Japanese-American businesses remain.[25]During 1942,Pinedale, in what is now North Fresno, was the site of thePinedale Assembly Center, an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno areaJapanese Americanstointernment camps.[26]TheFresno Fairgroundswere also utilized as an assembly center.
Row crops and orchards gave way to urban development particularly in the period after World War II; this transition was particularly vividly demonstrated in locations such as theBlackstone Avenuecorridor.
In September 1958,Bank of Americalaunched a new product calledBankAmericardin Fresno. After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the world's first successfulcredit card. This financial instrument was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today asVisa Inc.
In the 1960s, Fresno suffered numerous demolitions of historic buildings, including the oldFresno County Courthouseand the original buildings ofEdison High School.[why?]
The dance style commonly known aspoppingevolved in Fresno in the 1970s.[27]
In 1995, theFederal Bureau of Investigation'sOperation Rezonesting resulted in several prominent Fresno andClovispoliticians being charged in connection with taking bribes in return forrezoningfarmland for housing developments. Before the sting brought a halt to it, housing developers could buy farmland cheaply, pay off council members to have it rezoned, and make a large profit building and selling inexpensive housing. Sixteen people were eventually convicted as a result of the sting.[28]
In the early 2000s, Fresno's two major venues were built,Chukchansi Park(2002) andSave Mart Center(2003). The2017 Fresno shootingsresulted in the death of 4 people.


### Geography
Fresno has a total area of 116 square miles (300 km2) with 98.96% land covering 114.79 square miles (297.3 km2), and 1.04% water, 1.21 square miles (3.1 km2).
Fresno's location, very near the geographical center of California, places the city a comfortable distance from many of the major recreation areas and urban centers in the state. Just 60 mi (97 km) south ofYosemite National Park, it is the nearest major city to the park. Likewise,Sierra National Forestis 40 mi (64 km),Kings Canyon National Parkis 60 mi (97 km) andSequoia National Parkis 75 mi (121 km). The city is located near severalSierra Nevadalakes includingBass Lake,Shaver Lake, andHuntington Lake. Fresno is also only two and a half hours fromMonterey,Carmel,Big Surand the central coast.
Because Fresno sits at the junction of Highways41and99(SR 41 is Yosemite National Park's southern access road, and SR 99 bypassesInterstate 5to serve the urban centers of the San Joaquin Valley), the city is a major gateway for Yosemite visitors coming fromLos Angeles. The city also serves as an entrance into Sierra National Forest via Highway168, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks via Highway180.
Fresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest.Woodward Park, which features theShinzenJapanese Gardens, boasts numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails. It is in North Fresno and is adjacent to theSan Joaquin River Parkway.Roeding Park, near Downtown Fresno, is home to theFresno Chaffee Zoo, and Rotary Storyland andPlayland.Kearney Parkis the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.[29][30]
In its 2023 ParkScore ranking,The Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation organization, reported that Fresno had one of the worst park systems among the 100 most populous U.S. cities, with only 5% of city land being used for parks and recreation.[31]The survey measures median park size, park acres as percent of city area, residents' access to parks, spending on parks per resident, and playgrounds per 10,000 residents.


### Neighborhoods
[32]The Central Pacific Railroad built a small wooden depot in 1872. In 1889, the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired Central Pacific, constructed a new depot on the original depot site. The brick Queen Anne style depot was a jewel for the city and is one of Fresno's oldest standing buildings. In 1971, 99 years after it first opened for business on its current site, the Depot closed its rail operations due to the decline in business.[33]
Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric streetcars,[34]and contained a number of "lavish" and "opulent" buildings.[35]Among them, the original Fresno County Courthouse (demolished), the Fresno Carnegie Public Library (demolished), theOld Fresno Water Tower, theBank of Italy Building, thePacific Southwest Building, theSan Joaquin Light and Power Building(currently known as the Grand 1401), and theHughes Hotel(burned down), to name a few.
Fulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation's firstpedestrian mallsin 1964.[36]Renamed theFulton Mall, the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno. While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including a casting ofPierre-Auguste Renoir's bronze "The Washer Woman", reportedly the only one of the six castings that one can walk up to and touch. In October 2017, the City of Fresno finished and opened Fulton Mall to traffic, becoming Fulton Street. This change was celebrated with a large public parade featuring current Mayor Lee Brand and former Mayor Ashley Swearengin.[37]The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian-friendly environment of the district.[38]
The historicTower Theatre, which is included on the National Register of Historic Places,[39]is the center of the Tower District. The theater was built in 1939 at the corner of Olive and Wishon Avenues. The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College.[40]Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School (later renamedCalifornia State University at Fresno). In 1916, the college moved to what is now the site ofFresno City Collegeone-half mile north[41]of the Tower District.
After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second- and third-run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater &Good Company Playersalso opened nearby in 1978,[42]at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno nativeAudra McDonaldperformed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student. McDonald subsequently became a leading performer onBroadwayin New York City and aTony award-winning actress. Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players' 2nd Space Theatre.
The Tower District is a hub for community events such as Jamaica My Weekend, Mardi Gras in February,Gay Pride Parade, car shows, A Taste of The Tower, Halloween in the Tower, theFarmers' marketopened on the northwest corner of Olive and Van Ness and LitHop, an annual literary festival, featuring mostly local writers.
The neighborhood features restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores on or near Olive Avenue. Since renewal, the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses. The Tower District is known as the center of Fresno'sLGBTandhipstercommunities.[43]
The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades. The area includes manyCalifornia BungalowandAmerican Craftsmanstyle homes,Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture,Mediterranean Revival Style architecture,Mission Revival Style architecture, and manyStorybook housesdesigned by Fresno architects, Hilliard, Taylor & Wheeler.[citation needed]The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homesurban sprawlin north and east areas of Fresno.
In the northeastern part of Fresno,Woodward Parkwas founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park andbird sanctuaryin Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the southern bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the city, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2).[44]Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The park has a multi-useamphitheatrethat seats up to 2,500 people, an authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, bike park, two playgrounds, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, three small ponds, seven picnic areas, and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's amphitheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such asDeftones,Tech N9ne, andSevendustas well as numerous others. Woodward Park hosts the annualCalifornia Interscholastic FederationState Championshipcross countrymeet. It is the home of theWoodward Shakespeare Festivalwhich began performances in the park in 2005.[45]
Located in the western portion of Fresno,Old Fig Gardenis an unincorporated community that, over time, has been completely encircled by the city of Fresno. Fig Garden was created in 1947, as the then-known Fig Garden Men's club achieved nonprofit corporate status, allowing itself to have much more governance.[46]
In 1979, the name was changed to Fig Garden Home Owners Association.[46]Fig Garden is unique to the rest of Fresno, as it features largely no sidewalks and is lined with various large trees. The homes are well-maintained and landscaped due to strict regulations from the homeowners association. Due to a tax Fig Garden residences voted for, there is nearly round-the-clock sheriff service within the district.[46]The district hosts the Fig Garden Christmas Tree Lane, which is a nationally recognized event.[47]There is also an upscale swim and racquet club located in northwestern Fig garden, which has multiple amenities including a heated lap pool, massage therapy, daycare, etc.[48]Towards the northern boundary there is a shopping center called Fig Garden Village which hosts a plethora of upscale shopping opportunities.[49]

Fresno is the largest U.S. city not directly linked to anInterstate highway.[89]When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is nowInterstate 5on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99.[90]Due to rapidly rising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely asInterstate 7 or 9. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.
