 is a 
city
 in the 
U.S. state
 of 
North Carolina
 and the 
county seat
 of 
Durham County
.
[
12
]
 Small portions of the city limits extend into 
Orange County
 and 
Wake County
. With a population of 283,506 in the 
2020 census
, Durham is the 
4th-most populous city
 in North Carolina, and the 
71st-most populous city
 in the United States.
[

]
 The city is located in the east-central part of the 
Piedmont
 region along the 
Eno River
. Durham is the core of the four-county 
Durham-Chapel Hill, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area
, which had an estimated population of 608,879 in 2023. The 
Office of Management and Budget
 also includes Durham as a part of the 
Raleigh
-Durham-
Cary
, NC 
Combined Statistical Area
, commonly known as the 
Research Triangle
, which had an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023.
[

]


A railway depot was established in 1849 on land donated by 
Bartlett S. Durham
, the namesake of the city. Following the 
American Civil War
, the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the 
tobacco industry
. The town was incorporated by act of the 
North Carolina General Assembly
, in April 1869. The establishment of 
Durham County
 was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the 
American Tobacco Company
. 
Textile
 and 
electric power
 industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth
[
13
]
 to become an educational, medical, and research center.
[
14
]


Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably 
Duke University
 and 
North Carolina Central University
. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the 
Duke University Hospital
 and many private companies. Duke and its 
Duke University Health System
 are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a 
historically black university
 that is part of the 
University of North Carolina System
. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the 
Research Triangle
 area; central to this is the 
Research Triangle Park
[
15
]
 south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.

On the Duke University campus are the 
neo-Gothic
 
Duke Chapel
 and the 
Nasher Museum of Art
. Other notable sites in the city include the 
Museum of Life and Science
, 
Durham Performing Arts Center
, 
Carolina Theatre
, and 
Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory
. 
Bennett Place
 commemorates the location where 
Joseph E. Johnston
 surrendered to 
William T. Sherman
 in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with 
Raleigh
, by 
Raleigh–Durham International Airport
.

The 
Eno
 and the 
Occoneechi
, related to the 
Sioux
 and the 
Shakori
, lived in the area and may have established a village named Adshusheer (or Ajusher) in the area which became Durham.
[

The Occaneechi Path
, a corridor of trading roads and trails, went through the area. Native Americans expanded the region by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.

In 1701, English explorer 
John Lawson
, documented the area and would later call it "the flower of the Carolinas". Lawson claimed that Ajusher was situated 14 miles (23 km) from Occaneechi Town.

, a grant that had by then been inherited by his great-grandson 
John
. Early settlers built settlements as well as farms and mills, like 
West Point Mill
.

Frontiersmen in the area, prior to the 
American Revolutionary War
, participated in the

. Loyalist militia used Cornwallis Road to cut through the area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. William Johnston, a local a farmer and shopkeeper, made munitions for the 
Continental Army
, served in the 
Provincial Congress
 in 1775, and financially supported 
Daniel Boone
 on his westward explorations.

Antebellum and Civil War
[
edit
]


Prior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east–west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.
[
20
]


Large plantations, 
Hardscrabble
, 
Fairntosh
, 
Lipscomb
, 
Walnut Hall
, 
Patterson
, and 
Leigh
 among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, 
Stagville Plantation
 lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free 
African-Americans
 in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.

Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new 
North Carolina Railroad
 needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than "a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad" and refused to sell or lease land for a depot.
[
21
]
 In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by 
Dr. Bartlett S. Durham
; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift.
[
22
]
 A 
U.S. post office
 was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city's official birthday.
[
22
]


Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General 
William T. Sherman
 occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General 
Joseph E. Johnston
, was headquartered in 
Greensboro
 50 miles (80 km) to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. 
Robert E. Lee
 at 
Appomattox, Virginia
 on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at 
Bennett Place
, the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Durham Station.

As both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's 
Brightleaf tobacco
, which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.

Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco
[
edit
]

 tobacco factory and family home, Durham, 1883


The community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving 
tobacco
 industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the "
Bull Durham Tobacco Factory
".
[
22
]
 The name "Bull Durham" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British 
Colman's
 Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in 
Durham
, England.
[
24
]
 Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in 
Durham
, England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of 
Colman's
 of 
Norwich
, England.

Incorporation
[
edit
]


As Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the 
North Carolina General Assembly
, on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of 
Durham County
 was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of 
Wake County
. In 1911, parts of 
Cedar Fork Township
 of 
Wake County
 was transferred to Durham County and became 
Carr Township
.

Early growth (1900–1970)
[
edit
]


Overlooking the newly renovated 
American Tobacco Campus


The rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and 
Washington Duke
's W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Throughout the 
Gilded Age
 and into the early twentieth century, Durham industrialists, including 
George Washington Watts
, 
John Sprunt Hill
, and 
Julian S. Carr
, built large mansions such as 
Somerset Villa
, 
Harwood Hall
, the 
John Sprunt Hill House
, and 
Greystone Manor
. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as 
American Tobacco
, a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.



Looking west along Parrish Street, home of what was then known as Black Wall Street


Prevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. 
Duke Power
 (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910–1920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local "powerhouses". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco.
[
25
]
 Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now the 
Durham Area Transit Authority
) until 1991.

The success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.

Much of the early city 
architecture
, both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890–1930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.
[
26
]


Durham quickly developed a black community, the center of which was an area known as 
Hayti
, (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses — the best known of which are 
North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company
 and 
Mechanics & Farmers Bank
 — were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as "Black Wall Street."
[
27
]
 In 1910, 
Dr. James E. Shepard
 founded 
North Carolina Central University
, the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.

In 1924, 
James Buchanan Duke
 established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father 
Washington Duke
 to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to 
Duke University
 and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the 
Duke East Campus
).
[
28
]


Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. 
Textile
 mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.



Downtown Durham, 1942 or earlier


In a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first "science park" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the 
Research Triangle Park
 an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.
[

Civil rights movement
[
edit
]


As a result of its substantial African-American community, including many activists, a prominent 
civil rights movement
 developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and 
Martin Luther King Jr.
, visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and 
James E. Shepard
, has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, 
Douglas E. Moore
, minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.

Widely credited as the 
first sit-in of the civil rights movement in North Carolina
, on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the 
segregated
 
Royal Ice Cream Parlor
 and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the 
Greensboro Four
, three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.
[
31
]
[
32
]
[
33
]


The six-month-long sit-in at a 
Woolworth
's counter in 
Greensboro, North Carolina
, captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry "Fill up the jails," during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, "Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South."

This community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s.
[
34
]
 The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hill, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.



1970s–present
[
edit
]


The renovations of former tobacco buildings are central to the revitalization efforts in downtown Durham


In 1970, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 38.8% black and 60.8% white.
[
35
]
 Durham's growth began to rekindle during the 1970s and 1980s, with the construction of multiple housing developments in the southern part of the city, nearest 
Research Triangle Park
, and the beginnings of downtown revitalization. In 1975, the St. Joseph's Historical Foundation at the Hayti Heritage Center was incorporated to "preserve the heritage of the old Hayti community, and to promote the understanding of and appreciation for the African American experience and African Americans' contributions to world culture."
[
36
]


In 1987, the American Tobacco Factory in Durham closed, leading to an economic downturn and a decline in the city's reputation.
[
37
]
 A new downtown baseball stadium was constructed for the 
Durham Bulls
 in 1994. The 
Durham Performing Arts Center
 now ranks in the top ten in theater ticket sales in the US according to Pollstar magazine. Many famous people have performed there including 
B.B. King
 and 
Willie Nelson
. After the departure of the tobacco industry, large-scale renovations of the historic factories into offices, condominiums, and restaurants began to reshape downtown.
[
38
]
 While these efforts continue, the large majority of Durham's residential and retail growth since 1990 has been along the I-40 corridor in southern Durham County.
[
39
]


Major employers in Durham are Duke University and Duke Medical Center (39,000 employees, 14,000 students), about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the original downtown area, and companies in the Research Triangle Park (49,000 employees), about 10 miles (16 km) southeast. These centers are connected by the Durham Freeway (
NC 147
).

In recent years the city of Durham has stepped up revitalization of its downtown and undergone an economic and cultural renaissance of sorts. Partnering with developers from around the world, the city continues to promote the redevelopment of many of its former tobacco districts, projects supplemented by the earlier construction of the 
Durham Performing Arts Center
 and new 
Durham Bulls Athletic Park
.
[
40
]
 The 
American Tobacco Historic District
, adjacent to both the athletic park and performing arts center, is one such project, having successfully lured a number of restaurants, entertainment venues, and office space geared toward hi-tech entrepreneurs, investors, and startups.
[
41
]
 Many other companies have purchased and renovated historic buildings, such as 
Measurement Incorporated
 and 
Capitol Broadcasting Company
.
The American Underground section of the American Tobacco Campus, home to successful small software firms including 
Red Hat
, was selected by 
Google
 to host its launch of the 
Google Glass
 Road show in October 2013.
[
42
]
 The district is also slated for expansion featuring 158,000 square feet of offices, retail, residential or hotel space
[
43
]
 The 
Durham County Justice Center
, a major addition to downtown Durham, was completed in early 2013.

Many of the historic tobacco buildings elsewhere in the city have been converted into loft-style apartment complexes. The downtown corridor along West Main St. has seen significant redevelopment including bars, entertainment venues, art studios,
[
44
]
 and 
co-working
 spaces,
[
45
]
 in addition to shopping and dining in nearby 
Brightleaf Square
, another former tobacco warehouse in the 
Bright Leaf Historic District
. Other current and future projects include expansion of the open-space surrounding the 
American Tobacco Trail
, new hotels and apartment complexes, a $6.35-million facelift of Durham City Hall, and ongoing redevelopment of the Duke University Central Campus.

In 2013, 
21c Museum Hotels
 announced plans to fully renovate the 
Hill Building
. The renovations added a contemporary art museum and upscale restaurant to the historic building. Additionally, a boutique hotel was built in this major renovation effort in downtown Durham. 
Skanska
 is responsible for managing this project.
[

In 2014, it was announced that downtown Durham would be the site of a brand new 27 story high building, tentatively named "City Center Tower," but now called "
One City Center
".
[
48
]
 Along with other new buildings in downtown Durham, it was under construction in 2018.
[
49
]
 Construction has already started, and the building will be at the corner of Main St. and Corcoran St. It will be directly across from Durham's current tallest building, but once completed, will be the new tallest building in downtown Durham and the 4th largest building in the Triangle. Originally scheduled for a 2016 opening, the building was then expected to open in May 2018.
[
50
]
 This is an ambitious, $80 million project.
[
51
]
[
52
]


In October 2014, a major new development, the Durham Innovation District, was announced. The development will span 15 acres and comprise over 1.7 million square feet of office, residential, and retail space.
[
53
]
[

]


On April 10, 2019, a 
gas explosion
 rocked Kaffeinate, a coffee shop in 
Bright Leaf Historic District
. The blast destroyed a city block and killed Kong Lee, the owner, as well as injuring 25 others.

The soil is predominantly clay, making it poor for agriculture. The 
Eno River
, a tributary of the 
Neuse River

Climate
[

Durham is classified as a 
humid subtropical climate
 (
Cfa
) according to the 
Köppen classification
, with hot and humid summers, cool winters, and warm to mild spring and autumn. Durham receives abundant precipitation, with thunderstorms common in the summer and temperatures from 80 to 100 degrees F. The region sees an average of 6.8 inches (170 mm) of snow per year, which usually melts within a few days.

Durham consistently ranks in the top 10 least challenging places to live with seasonal allergies.
[
56
]


Climate change is expected to increase the number of days of extreme precipitation in Durham as well as moderately increase temperature within the region. The number of days of inland flooding within the Piedmont is also expected to increase, which puts Durham at higher risk of future flooding.
[
57

Durham Bulls Athletic Park


Durham's professional sports team is the 
Durham Bulls
 
International League
 
baseball
 team. A movie involving an earlier 
Carolina League
 team of that name, 
Bull Durham
, was produced in 1988. Today's Bulls play in the 
Durham Bulls Athletic Park
, on the southern end of downtown, constructed in 1994. One of the more successful teams in the minor leagues, the Bulls usually generate an annual attendance of around 500,000. Previously 
Durham Athletic Park
 (DAP), located on the northern end of downtown, had served as the Bull's ballpark. Historically, many players for the current and former Durham Bulls teams have transferred to the big leagues after several years in the minor leagues. DAP has been preserved for the use of other teams as well as for concerts sponsored by the City of Durham and other events. The Durham Dragons, a women's fast pitch 
softball
 team, played in the Durham Athletic Park from 1998 to 2000. The DAP recently went through a $5 million renovation.



Government and politics

Government
[
edit
]


Durham operates under a 
council–manager form of government
.
[
95
]
 The city is led by a city council and a mayor. Council members are chosen in staggered elections to serve four year terms, while mayoral elections are held every two years.
[
96
]
 The mayor presides over meetings of the city council and makes some committee appointments, while much of the regular management of the city's administration falls to the 
city manager
.
[
97
]
 In November 2021, 
Elaine O'Neal
 was elected mayor of Durham, becoming the first 
black
 female mayor in the city.
[
98
]
 The current mayor is 
Leonardo Williams
, who was elected in November 2023.
[
99
]


Federally, Durham is in 
North Carolina's 4th congressional district
, which is represented by Democrat 
Valerie Foushee
.

The new 
Durham County Justice Center
 was completed in early 2013.



Politics
[
edit
]


The area is predominantly 
Democratic
, and has voted for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in every election since the city's founding in 1869. Durham County is the most liberal-leaning county in North Carolina, with over 80% of the county voting for Democratic candidate 
Joe Biden
 in the 
2020 presidential election
.
[
100
]
 The city's politics have long been dominated by the activities of two local 
political action committees
, the 
People's Alliance
 (PA) and the 
Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People
 (DCABP). PA is a mostly-white progressive organization, while the DCABP is a black moderate group.

Key political issues have been the redevelopment of Downtown Durham and revival of other historic neighborhoods and commercial districts, ending cash bail, ending mandatory sentencing minimums, decriminalization of marijuana, raising minimum wage for city employees to $15, the fluoridation of public drinking water, a 45% reduction of crime, a 10-year plan to end homelessness, initiatives to reduce truancy, issues related to growth and development. Naturally, a merger of Durham City Schools (several 
inner city
 neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s has not been without controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council's 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit.
[
102
]
 In 2018, Durham appointed its first 
Latino
 council member 
Javiera Caballero
.

Durham's Amtrak station


Downtown Durham Station used by GoDurham and GoTriangle


See also: 
Durham, North Carolina (Amtrak station)


Most travel in Durham is by private motor vehicle on its network of public streets and highways. Important arteries for traffic include 
NC 147
, which connects Duke University, downtown, and Research Triangle Park, 
U.S. 15-501
 between Durham and 
Chapel Hill
, 
I-85
, connecting Durham to Virginia and western North Carolina cities, and I-40 running across southern Durham County between the Research Triangle Park and Chapel Hill. The I-40 corridor has been the main site of commercial and residential development in Durham since its opening in the early 1990s. Over 95% of commuters use a car to get to work, with 14% of those people in carpools.

Durham maintains an extensive network of bicycle routes and trails and has been recognized with a Bicycle Friendly Community Award.
[
111
]
 The 
American Tobacco Trail
 begins in downtown and continues south through Research Triangle Park and ends in Wake County. The city is also considering furthering the progress on the Triangle Greenway System.

Air travel is serviced by 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport
, 12 miles southeast of Durham, which enplanes about 4.5 million passengers per year. Frequent service (five flights a day or more) is available to Boston, Charlotte, Philadelphia, New York LaGuardia, New York Kennedy, Newark, Washington Reagan, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta, GA. Non-stop daily service is provided to approximately 30 destinations in the United States and daily international service is also available to London Heathrow, Toronto-Pearson and Paris Charles de Gaulle.

Amtrak
 operates the daily 
Carolinian
 train between Charlotte and New York City which stops in downtown Durham. The State of North Carolina, in cooperation with Amtrak, operates four additional daily 
Piedmont
 trains between Raleigh and Charlotte which also stop in Durham. A new Amtrak station was built in 2011 in a former tobacco warehouse. Some of the downtown streets cross the tracks at grade level, while other intersections have grade separation. One downtown 
railroad underpass
 has attracted national media coverage, because it provided only 11 feet-8 inches of clearance, and has damaged the roofs of many trucks.
[
112
]
 On October 26, 2019, the underpass was closed down to both automotive and train traffic for raising it to 12 feet and 4 inches, so as to provide clearance underneath to reduce large vehicle damage, nonetheless a few accidents still occur.
[
113
]


National bus service is provided by 
Greyhound
 and 
Megabus
 at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009. 
GoDurham
 provides municipal bus service.



Durham Station Transportation Center


GoTriangle
 offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, 
Cary
 and 
Chapel Hill
, as well as to and from the 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport
, 
Research Triangle Park
 and several of the region's larger suburban communities. GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive 
vanpool
 and 
rideshare
 program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.

From 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a 28-mile (45 km) rail corridor from northeast 
Raleigh
, through downtown Raleigh, 
Cary
, and 
Research Triangle Park
, to Durham using 
DMU
 technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles (11 km) to 
Chapel Hill
 with 
light rail
 technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the 
Federal Transit Administration
 declined to fund the program.  Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region. The project was cancelled 2019 with costs more than $157 million.
[
114
]
[
115
]
[
116
]


The region's two 
metropolitan planning organizations
 appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.
[
117
]


Duke University
 also maintains its own transit system, Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses with routes throughout the campus and health system. Duke campus buses and vans have alternate schedules or do not operate during breaks and holidays.

In an effort to create safer roadways for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, drivers can enroll in Durham's 
Pace Car Program
 and agree to drive the speed limit, stop at all stop signs, stop at all red lights, and stop to let pedestrians cross the street.
