'''Falls Church City''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]], United States.<ref name=GNIS1/> As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the population was 14,658.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Falls Church city, Falls Church city, Virginia|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0600000US5161093531|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=January 30, 2022}}</ref> Falls Church is part of both [[Northern Virginia]] and the [[Washington metropolitan area]]. As of 2020, it has a median household income of $146,922, the [[List of highest-income counties in the United States|second-highest household income]] of any county in the nation behind [[Loudoun County, Virginia]].

Taking its name from [[the Falls Church]], an 18th-century [[Church of England]], later the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], Falls Church gained township status within [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] in 1875.

In 1948, it seceded from Fairfax County and was incorporated as the City of Falls Church, an independent city with county-level governance status although it is not nominally a county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library1.municode.com:80/default-test/template.htm?view=browse&doc_action=setdoc&doc_keytype=tocid&doc_key=6ec2ad22ea16c9281cae3c80eb841477&infobase=14329 |title=Municipal Code of the City of Falls Church: Incorporation and Boundaries |publisher=Library1.municode.com:80 |access-date=May 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121010054/http://library1.municode.com/default-test/template.htm?view=browse&doc_action=setdoc&doc_keytype=tocid&doc_key=6ec2ad22ea16c9281cae3c80eb841477&infobase=14329 |archive-date=January 21, 2012}}</ref>

The city's corporate boundaries do not include all of the area historically known as Falls Church; these areas include portions of [[Seven Corners, Virginia|Seven Corners]] and other portions of the current Falls Church postal districts in Fairfax County and [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], known as [[East Falls Church, Virginia|East Falls Church]], which was part of the town of Falls Church from 1875 to 1936.<ref>Gernard and Netherton, ''Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited'', p.65.</ref> For statistical purposes, the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]]'s [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines the City of Falls Church with [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax City]] and Fairfax County.

At 2.11 square miles, Falls Church is the smallest incorporated municipality in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the smallest county-equivalent municipality in the United States.

== Etymology ==

[[File:Falls church virginia 1878.jpg|thumb|Map of Falls Church in 1878]]

The [[independent city]] of Falls Church is named for the 1734 [[Church of England]] (later [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) church building named [[the Falls Church]] founded at the intersection of important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trails that were later paved and named Broad Street, Lee Highway and Little Falls Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fallschurchva.gov/758/About-Falls-Church |title=About Falls Church |publisher=Fallschurchva.gov |access-date=May 14, 2012}}</ref> The church’s name was derived from its proximity to the Little Falls of the [[Potomac River]], a set of rapids located several miles to the northeast. These "falls" were a well-known landmark to early colonists and surveyors in the [[18th century]], and the church became associated with them despite being some distance inland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History|title=About and History |publisher=Fallschurchva.gov |access-date=May 5, 2025}}</ref>

Over time, the community surrounding The Falls Church came to be identified simply as “Falls Church,” and the name persisted as civic and administrative structures developed. When the area was incorporated as an [[independent city]] in 1948, the name was officially retained, reflecting both the continuity of local identity and the long-standing influence of the church. Notably, Falls Church is one of only a few [[United States]] cities whose name originates from a specific house of worship and one that still exists and functions today highlighting the lasting symbolic and historical significance of the original [[18th century|18th-century]] structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thefallschurch.org/earlyhistory|title=Early History|publisher=TheFallsChurch:An Episcopal Congregation|access-date=May 6, 2025}}</ref>

[[File:Fairfax County Map.png|thumb|Map of Falls Church , VA / Fairfax County]]

Despite being an [[independent city]] ,  the broader “Falls Church” area commonly includes nearby communities such as [[Seven Corners, Virginia|Seven Corners]], [[Pimmit Hills, Virginia|Pimmit Hills]], [[West Falls Church, Virginia|West Falls Church]], and [[Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia|Baileys Crossroads]] which lie outside the city’s official boundaries in unincorporated [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]. These areas use Falls Church mailing addresses and share [[ZIP Code|ZIP codes]] like 22042, 22043, and 22044, despite being governed separately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/|title=Falls Church (Zip Code Boundaries)|publisher=UnitedStatesZipCodes.org|access-date=May 6, 2025}}</ref> This shared address also comes with development and transportation networks that are integrated with the city of Falls Church.  The proximity to key transit routes like [[Interstate 66]], Route 50, and [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Metro’s Orange and Silver Lines]] highlight the regions importance in terms of regional impact since its origins<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/west-falls-church.cfm|title=West Falls Church (Station)|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority |access-date=May 6, 2025}}</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Falls Church}}
The first known government in the area was the [[Iroquois Confederacy]].<ref>Bradley E. Gernand and Nan Netherton, ''Falls Church—A Virginia Village Revisited''. Virginia Beach: The Donning Company, 2000. Page 13, citing interviews with [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] archaeologists Michael Johnson and Martha Williams.</ref> After exploration by [[Captain John Smith]], England began sending colonists to what they called Virginia.<ref>Gernand and Netherton, ''Falls Church'', p. 13, citing Fairfax Harrison, ''The Landmarks of Old Prince William'', pp. 143, 148.</ref> While no records have yet been found showing the earliest colony settlement in the area, a cottage demolished between 1908 and 1914, two blocks from the city center, bore a stone engraved with the date "1699" set into one of its two large chimneys.<ref>Gernand and Netherton, ''Falls Church'', p. 13, citing Melvin Steadman, ''Falls Church By Fence and Fireside'', pp. iii, x.</ref>

During the [[American Revolution]] the area is most known for the Falls Church vestrymen [[George Washington]] and [[George Mason]].<ref>Gernand and Netherton, ''Falls Church'', p. 27, citing Emily Salmon and Edward Campell, ''Hornbook of Virginia History'', pp. 27–29; Nan Netherton, ''Fairfax County'', pp. 102–103; Tony Wrenn, ''Falls Church—History of a Village'', p. 6.</ref> A copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was read to citizens from the steps of the Falls Church during the summer of 1776.<ref>Gernand and Netherton, ''Falls Church'', p. 28, citing Beekman, ''Bridges and the City of Washington'', pp. v, 1, 3.</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]] Falls Church voted 44–26 in favor of secession.<ref>Gernand, ''A Virginia Village Goes to War'', pp. 22–29, quoting Southern Claims Commission case files and ''Evening Star'' newspaper articles.</ref> The Confederate army occupied the then village of Falls Church as well as [[Munson's Hill|Munson's]] and [[Upton's Hill|Upton's]] hills to the East, probably due to their views of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].<ref>Gernand, pp.&nbsp;56–62, quoting ''Evening Star'', ''New York Times'' and ''Hartford Courant'' newspaper articles and regimental histories.</ref> On September 28, 1861, Confederate troops withdrew from Falls Church and nearby hills, retreating to the heights at [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]]. Union troops took Munson's and Upton's hills, yet the village was never entirely brought under Union rule.<ref>Gernand, ''A Virginia Village Goes to War'', pp. 98–100, quoting newspaper articles published in the ''New York Times'', ''Evening Star'', ''Elmira Weekly Advertiser'', ''Buffalo Daily Courier'', several regimental histories, and soldiers' letters home.</ref> [[Mosby's Raiders (American Civil War)|Mosby's Raiders]] made several armed incursions into the heart of Falls Church to kidnap and murder suspected Northern sympathizers in 1864 and 1865.<ref>Gernand, ''A Virginia Village Goes to War'', pp. 191–195, 200–201, 203–211, quoting Southern Claims Commission case files; books regarding Mosby's Raiders; and a local history of Falls Church which cites family members’ statements.</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land and none of it water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Falls Church is the smallest independent city by area in Virginia. Since independent cities in Virginia are considered county-equivalents, it is also the [[County statistics of the United States|smallest county-equivalent in the United States]] by area.

The center of the city is the crossroads of [[Virginia State Route 7]] (Broad St./Leesburg Pike) and [[U.S. Route 29]] (Washington St./Lee Highway).

Tripps Run, a tributary of the [[Cameron Run Watershed]], drains two-thirds of Falls Church, while the [[Four Mile Run]] watershed drains the other third of the city. Four Mile Run flows at the base of [[Minor's Hill]], which overlooks Falls Church on its north, and [[Upton's Hill]], which bounds the area to its east.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fallschurchenvironment.org/hills_valleys.html |title=The Hills and Valleys of Falls Church |publisher=Fallschurchenvironment.org |access-date=May 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226155054/http://www.fallschurchenvironment.org/hills_valleys.html |archive-date=February 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Cultural institutions===
[[File:Mary Riley Styles Public Library.jpg|alt=Falls Church Public library|thumb|Mary Riley Styles Public Library]]
[[File:The State Theatre.jpg|thumb|The State Theatre]]
The Falls Church Village Preservation and Improvement Society was founded in 1885 by Arthur Douglas and re-established in 1965 to promote the history, culture, and beautification of the city. The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation was founded in 1997 by Edwin B. Henderson II to preserve the Civil Rights and African American history and culture. Falls Church is where the first rural branch of the NAACP was established stemming from events that took place in 1915, when the town passed a segregation ordinance by creating segregated districts in the town. The ordinance was not enforced after the U. S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' in 1917. The Mary Riley Styles Public Library is Falls Church's public library; established in 1899, its current building was constructed for the purpose in 1958 and expanded in 1993 and 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mrspl.org/about/about-us | title=About Us &#124; Mary Riley Styles Public Library }}</ref> In addition to its circulating collections, it houses a local history collection, including newspaper files, local government documents, and photographs. The [[State Theatre (Falls Church, Virginia)|State Theatre]] stages a wide variety of live performances. Built as a movie house in 1936, it was reputed to be the first air-conditioned theater on the east coast. It closed in 1983; after extensive renovations in the 1990s, including a stage, bar, and restaurant, it re-opened as a music venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatetheatre.com/venue_info/history.xml |title=The State Theatre – History |publisher=Thestatetheatre.com |date=November 27, 1988 |access-date=May 14, 2012}}</ref>

==Government==
Like most cities near the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], Falls Church is a Democratic powerhouse, most notably in recent elections. It has not supported a Republican presidential candidate since 1984. With the exception of 2012 and 2024, the Democratic share of the vote in the city has increased in every election since 1988, peaking in 2020 when [[Joe Biden]] broke 80% of the vote, the best Democratic performance since the city's incorporation.

East Falls Church is the westernmost designated transfer station.
* The [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] provides bus service throughout the Washington metropolitan area, including Falls Church.
* A small portion of the {{convert|45|mi|km|adj=on}} Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Trail (W&OD Trail) runs through the city (see: [[Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park]]). The trail enters the city from the west between mile markers 7 and 7.5 (near Broad Street). The trail enters the city from the east between mile markers 5.5 and 6.
