==Geography==
[[Image:SilverSpringCDP2010.PNG|thumb|A map marking the boundaries of Silver Spring (in dark orange) as of 2010]]
As an unincorporated [[census-designated place]], Silver Spring's boundaries are not consistently defined. As of the [[2010 United States census|2010 census]], the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] gives Silver Spring a total area of {{convert|7.92|sqmi|sqkm}}, which is all land; however, the CDP contains some creeks and small ponds. This definition is a 15% reduction from the {{convert|9.4|sqmi}} used in previous years.

Silver Spring contains the following neighborhoods: Downtown Silver Spring, East Silver Spring, [[Woodside (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Woodside]], [[Woodside Park (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Woodside Park]], [[Lyttonsville]], North Hills Sligo Park, Long Branch, Indian Spring, Goodacre Knolls, [[Franklin Knolls (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Franklin Knolls]], Montgomery Knolls, Clifton Park Village, New Hampshire Estates, and Oakview.

Landmarks in the downtown area include the [[AFI Silver|AFI Silver Theatre]], the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]], a branch of [[The Fillmore Silver Spring|The Fillmore]], and the headquarters of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. Greater Silver Spring includes the headquarters of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/BuildingsandFacilities/WhiteOakCampusInformation/ |title=White Oak Campus Information |publisher=US FDA |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421021526/http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/BuildingsandFacilities/WhiteOakCampusInformation/ |archive-date=April 21, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] in the U.S.

===Parks and recreation===

Four major creeks run through Silver Spring: from west to east, they are [[Rock Creek (Potomac River tributary)|Rock Creek]], [[Sligo Creek]], Long Branch, and [[Northwest Branch Anacostia River|Northwest Branch]]. Each is surrounded by parks offering hiking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas, and tennis courts.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, present-day Silver Spring was inhabited by various [[Native American tribes in Maryland|Indigenous peoples]] for approximately 10,000 years, including the [[Piscataway people|Piscataway]], an [[Piscataway language|Algonquian-speaking]] people. The Piscataway may have established a few small villages along the banks of Sligo Creek and Rock Creek.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montgomeryplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NorthWestSilverSpringMasterPlan2000ocr300.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221010/http://montgomeryplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NorthWestSilverSpringMasterPlan2000ocr300.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-10 |url-status=live |title=APPROVED AND ADOPTED NORTH and WEST SILVER SPRING MASTER PLAN |publisher=The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission |access-date=2019-08-24}}</ref>

===19th century===
The Blair, Lee, and Jalloh and Barrie families, three politically active families of the time, are tied to Silver Spring's history. In 1840, [[Francis Preston Blair]], who later helped organize the modern [[Republican Party (United States)|American Republican Party]], along with his daughter, Elizabeth, discovered a spring flowing with chips of mica believed to be the now-dry spring visible at [[Acorn Park]].<ref name="montgomeryParks" /><ref name="wamu_2014-04-04" /><ref name="cannonroades" /> Blair was looking for a site for his summer home to escape the summer heat of Washington, D.C.<ref name= centuries>Sween, Jane C.; Offutt, William.

By 1854, Blair's son, [[Montgomery Blair]], who became [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] under [[Abraham Lincoln]] and represented [[Dred Scott]] before the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]], built the Falkland house in the area.

By the end of the decade, Elizabeth Blair married [[Samuel Phillips Lee]], third cousin of future [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] leader [[Robert E. Lee]], and gave birth to a boy, [[Blair Lee I|Francis Preston Blair Lee]], who went on to become the first popularly elected [[United States Senate|Senator]] in U.S. history.

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] visited the Silver Spring mansion several times, where he relaxed by playing [[town ball]] with Francis P. Blair's grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web |last=McCoy |first=Jerry A. |date=February 6, 2009 |title=Abe Lincoln in Silver Spring |work=Silver Spring Voice |url=http://www.takoma.com/ssthenagain/2009/02/abe-lincoln-in-silver-spring.html |access-date=March 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211164705/http://www.takoma.com/ssthenagain/2009/02/abe-lincoln-in-silver-spring.html |archive-date=February 11, 2009}}</ref>

At the time, there was a community called Sligo located at the intersection of the Washington-Brookeville Turnpike and the Washington-Colesville-Ashton Turnpike, now named Georgia Avenue and Colesville Road.<ref name= centuries/> Sligo included a tollhouse, a store, a post office, and a few homes.<ref name= centuries/> The communities of [[Woodside (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Woodside]], [[Forest Glen, Maryland|Forest Glen]], and Linden were founded after the Civil War.<ref name= centuries/> These small towns largely lost their separate identities when a post office was established in Silver Spring in 1899.<ref name= centuries/>

By the end of the 19th century, the region began to develop into a town of size and importance. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]'s [[Metropolitan Branch]] opened on April 30, 1873, and ran through Silver Spring from Washington, D.C., to [[Point of Rocks, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Metropolitan Railroad |work=The Evening Star |date=April 30, 1873 |page=4 |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX-NB&p_theme=ahnp&p_nbid=C60H50SGMTQxMTY2ODA4Ni43NTc1ODE6MTo3OnJhLTk2NjY&p_action=doc&s_lastnonissuequeryname=8&d_viewref=search&p_queryname=8&p_docnum=2&p_docref=v2:13D5DA85AE05A305@EANX-NB-13E15D48DBD605B8@2405279-13E0BBB8D13E65F0@3-13E1E2DA44A9F840@ |access-date=September 25, 2014 |archive-date=February 7, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207050723/https://infoweb.newsbank.com/home/login?destination=infoweb.newsbank.com%3Fdb%3DEANX-NB%26wedirect%3Dtrue |url-status=live}}</ref>

The first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on present-day Colesville Road ([[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|U.S. Route 29]]) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre (20,000- and 40,000 m<sup>2</sup>) plots. In 1892, [[Blair Lee I|Francis Preston Blair Lee]] and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to [[E. Brooke Lee]], who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region.<ref name=WW1>{{cite web |last=Dunaway |first=Karen |title=Edward Brooke Lee |url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/001500/001576/html/1576bio.html |work=Archives of Maryland (Biographical Series) |publisher=Maryland State Government |access-date=April 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113062808/http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/001500/001576/html/1576bio.html |archive-date=November 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, E. Brooke Lee and his brother, [[Blair Lee I]], founded the Lee Development Company, whose Colesville Road office building remains a downtown fixture. Dale Drive, a winding roadway, was built to provide vehicular access to much of the family's substantial real estate holdings. Suburban development continued in 1922 when Woodside Development Corporation created Woodside Park, a neighborhood of {{convert|1|acre|sqm|adj=on}} plot home sites built on the former Noyes estate in 1923.<ref>{{cite news |title=Work Being Pushed at Woodside Park |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 15, 1923 |page=46 |id={{ProQuest|149333195}}}}</ref> In 1924, Washington trolley service on [[Georgia Avenue]] (present-day [[Maryland Route 97]]) across B&O's Metropolitan Branch was suspended so that an underpass could be built. The underpass was completed two years later, but trolley service never resumed. It would be rebuilt again in 1948 with additional lanes for automobile traffic, opening the areas to the north for readily accessible suburban development.

Takoma-Silver Spring High School, built in 1924, was the first high school for Silver Spring. The community's rapid growth led to the need for a larger school. In 1935, when a new high school building was erected at Wayne Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway, the school was renamed [[Montgomery Blair High School]]. In 1998, the school was moved again, to a new, larger facility at the corner of Colesville Road ([[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|U.S. Route 29]]) and University Boulevard ([[Maryland Route 193]]). The former Blair building became a combined middle school and elementary school, housing Silver Spring International Middle School and Sligo Creek Elementary School.

Before the 1950s, Silver Spring was known as a [[sundown town]], in part because of influential land owners. The North Washington Real Estate Company designed 63 acres to be [[Housing segregation in the United States|white-only]], [[Racial covenant|written in its deeds]] to prevent the sale of land to anyone else. Legislation finally outlawed this practice in 1967, almost two decades after [[Shelley v. Kraemer|''Shelley v.

By the 1950s, Silver Spring was the second-busiest retail market between [[Baltimore]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; major retailers included the [[Hecht Company]], [[J.C. Penney]], and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]. In 1954, the 1842 Blair mansion "Silver Spring" was razed and replaced with the Blair Station post office. 1960 saw the opening of Wheaton Plaza, later called [[Westfield Wheaton]], a shopping center several miles north of downtown Silver Spring. It captured much of the town's business, and the downtown area began a long period of decline.

[[Washington Metro]] rail service into Washington, D.C., helped breathe new life into the region starting with the 1978 opening of the [[Silver Spring (Washington Metro)|Silver Spring station]]. The Metro [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] followed the right-of-way of the [[B&O Metropolitan Branch]], with the Metro tracks centered between the B&O's eastbound and westbound mains. The Red Line heads south to downtown DC from Silver Spring, running at grade before descending into [[Union Station (WMATA station)|Union Station]]. By the mid-1990s, the Red Line continued north from the downtown Silver Spring core, entering a tunnel just past the Silver Spring station and running underground to three more stations: [[Forest Glen station|Forest Glen]], [[Wheaton (Washington Metro)|Wheaton]], and [[Glenmont (Washington Metro)|Glenmont]].

Nevertheless, Silver Spring's downtown continued to decline in the 1980s. The [[Hecht Company]] closed its downtown location in 1987 and moved to Wheaton Plaza while forbidding another department store to rent its old spot. [[City Place Mall|City Place]], a multi-level mall, was established in the old Hecht Company building in 1992, but it had difficulty attracting quality anchor stores and gained a reputation as a budget mall. In the mid-1990s, developers considered building a mega-mall and entertainment complex called the American Dream (similar to the [[Mall of America]]) in downtown Silver Spring, but were unable to secure funding. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a bright spot was the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)'s consolidationg of its headquarters in four new high-rise office buildings near the Silver Spring Metro station.

A February 16, 1996, [[1996 Maryland train collision|train collision]] on the Silver Spring section of the Metropolitan line left 11 people dead. A [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter train bound for [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Washington Union Station]] during the Friday-evening [[rush hour]] collided with the [[Amtrak]] ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak train)|Capitol Limited]]'' train and erupted in flames on a snow-swept stretch of track.

At the beginning of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were rebuilt to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called Downtown Silver Spring. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a 2002 PBS documentary entitled ''Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095032/ |title=Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb (2002) |date=December 6, 2002 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=May 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405024653/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095032/ |archive-date=April 5, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2003, [[Discovery Communications]] moved its headquarters from nearby [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] to a new building in downtown Silver Spring. (Its residency would last less than 15 years: in 2017, [[Discovery, Inc.]] CEO [[David Zaslav]] announced that he would move the company to New York City to operate close to their "ad partners on Madison Avenue," "investors and analysts on Wall Street," and their "creative and production community".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/01/09/discovery-communications-is-selling-md-headquarters-and-moving-to-new-york/ |url-access=subscription |title=Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York |author=Abha Bhattarai |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018043244/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/01/09/discovery-communications-is-selling-md-headquarters-and-moving-to-new-york/ |archive-date=October 18, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>) 2003 also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as [[AFI Silver]], under the auspices of the [[American Film Institute]].

Development continued with the opening of new office buildings, condos, stores, and restaurants. In 2015–16, the long-struggling City Place Mall was renovated and reopened as Ellsworth Place The old [[Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station|B&O Passenger Station]] was restored between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film ''Next Stop: Silver Spring''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://silverspringtrain.blogspot.com/ |title=Next Stop: Silver Spring |publisher=Silverspringtrain.blogspot.com |date=September 3, 1964 |access-date=July 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827073035/http://silverspringtrain.blogspot.com/ |archive-date=August 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rKVuyz4Nw |title=Next Stop: Silver Spring – Trailer |website=[[YouTube]] |date=November 15, 2007 |access-date=July 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619114510/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rKVuyz4Nw |archive-date=June 19, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Beginning in 2004, the downtown redevelopment was marketed locally with the "silver sprung" advertising campaign, which declared on buses and in print ads that Silver Spring had "sprung" and was ready for business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2004/06/silversprung.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823100637/http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2004/06/silversprung.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 23, 2004 |title=Takoma Voice: News |publisher=Takoma.com |access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref> In June 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that downtown was "enjoying a renaissance, a result of public involvement and private investment that is turning it into an arts and entertainment center".<ref>Eugene L.

In 2007, the downtown Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in what appeared to be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Companies, a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited.<ref>Marc Fisher, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062002354.html "Public or Private Space?

In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, "Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment."<ref>[[Ruben Castaneda]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073001639.html "County Opinion Rejects Photo Limits"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202205853/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073001639.html |date=December 2, 2016 }}, ''The Washington Post'', July 31, 2007</ref> The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.

In 2008, construction began on the long-planned [[Intercounty Connector]] (ICC), which crosses the upper reaches of Silver Spring. The highway's first section opened on February 21, 2011; the entire route was completed by 2012. In July 2010, the Silver Spring Civic Building and Veterans Plaza opened in downtown Silver Spring.

In May 2019, Peterson announced a $10 million renovation of the Downtown Silver Spring development that will include public art and a new outdoor plaza, featuring green space.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diegel |first1=Mike |title=Downtown Silver Spring to Get $10 Million Renovation, New Tenants |url=https://www.sourceofthespring.com/silver-spring/downtown-silver-spring-10-million-renovation-new-tenants/ |website=Source of the Spring |access-date=19 October 2020 |archive-date=October 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020193606/https://www.sourceofthespring.com/silver-spring/downtown-silver-spring-10-million-renovation-new-tenants/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Silver Spring Stage, an all-volunteer community theater, performs in Woodmoor, approximately {{convert|3|mi|km}} north up Colesville Road from the downtown area. Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] that includes the [[National Weather Service]]; the [[American Nurses Association]]; and numerous real estate development, biotechnology, and media and communications companies.

[[Stevie Nicks]] of the band [[Fleetwood Mac]] has credited Silver Spring as an inspiration for the title of the band's 1977 song "[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]". In a 1998 interview, Nicks said, "I wrote Silver Springs uh, about [[Lindsey_Buckingham|Lindsey [Buckingham]]]. And I ~ we were in Maryland somewhere driving under a freeway sign that said Silver Spring, Maryland. And I loved the name. ...Silver Springs sounded like a pretty fabulous place to me. And uh, 'You could be my silver springs...' that's just a whole symbolic thing of what you could have been to me."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/silver.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Silver Springs |access-date=September 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623050203/http://www.inherownwords.com/silver.htm |archive-date=June 23, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Silver Spring Saints Youth Football Organization has been a mainstay of youth sports in the town since 1951. Located in Silver Spring, Maryland, the Silver Spring Saints play home games at St. Bernadette's Church near Blair High School. The club was formed when two local Catholic parishes, St. John the Baptist and St. Andrews, merged their football programs to compete in the Capital Beltway League after the CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) for the Archdiocese of Washington D.C. discontinued its youth football program at the end of the 1994 season. The name "Saints" is derived from the merging of the two Catholic parishes. In 2009, the Saints moved from the Capital Beltway League (CBL) to the Mid-Maryland Youth Football & Cheer League (MMYFCL).
