Tallahassee(/ˌtæləˈhæsi/TAL-ə-HASS-ee) is thecapital cityof the U.S. state ofFlorida. It is thecounty seatof and the only incorporated municipality inLeon County. Tallahassee became the capital of Florida, then theFlorida Territory, in 1824. As of the official 2020 U.S. Census, the city has a population of 196,169,[5]making it theninth-most populous city in Floridaat the time of that census.[6]It is the principal city of theTallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 397,675 as of 2024[update]. Tallahassee is the largest city in theFlorida Big BendandFlorida Panhandleregions.
With a student population exceeding 70,000, Tallahassee is acollege town, home toFlorida State University;Florida A&M University; andTallahassee State College, a state college in theFlorida College System.[7]
As the capital, Tallahassee is the site of theFlorida State Capitol,Supreme Court of Florida,Florida Governor's Mansion, and numerous state agency headquarters. The city is also home to several law firms, lobbying organizations, trade associations and professional associations, includingThe Florida Barand theFlorida Chamber of Commerce.[8]It is a regional center for some scientific research, and home to theNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory. In 2025, Tallahassee was awarded theAll-America City Awardby theNational Civic Leaguefor the third time.[9]


### History
Indigenous peoples occupied this area for thousands of years before European encounter. Around 1200, the large and complexMississippian culturehad built earthwork mounds near Lake Jackson which survive today; they are preserved in theLake Jackson Archaeological State Park.[10]
TheSpanish Empireestablished its first colonial settlement atSt. Augustine. During the 17th century, the Spanish established several missions inApalachee territoryto procure food and labor to support their settlement, and to convert the natives toRoman Catholicism. The largest,Mission San Luis de Apalacheein Tallahassee, has been partially reconstructed by the state of Florida.[11]
TheexpeditionofPánfilo de Narváezencountered the Apalachee people but did not reach the site of Tallahassee.Hernando de Sotoand his mid-16th-century expedition occupied the Apalachee town ofAnhaica(at what is now Tallahassee) in the winter of 1538–39. Based on archaeological excavations, this Anhaica site is known to have been about 0.5 miles (800 m) east of the presentFlorida State Capitol. The De Soto encampment is believed to be the first place that Christmas was celebrated in the continental United States.[12][13]
The nameTallahasseeis aMuskogeanlanguage word often translated as "old fields" or "old town".[14]It was likely an expression of theCreekpeople who migrated fromGeorgiaandAlabamato this region in the late 18th and early 19th centuries under pressure fromEuropean-Americanencroachment on their territory. They found large areas of cleared land previously occupied by theApalacheetribe. (The Creek and later refugees who joined them developed as theSeminoleIndians of Florida. TheTalimali Band of Apalachee IndiansinLouisianaidentify as present-day descendants of the Apalachee Indians.)[citation needed]
During theFirst Seminole War,General Andrew Jacksonfought twoskirmishesin and around Tallahassee, which was then Spanish territory. The first battle took place on November 12, 1817. After Chief Neamathla, of the village of Fowltown just west of present-day Tallahassee, refused Jackson's orders to relocate, Jackson entered the village, burnt it to the ground, and drove off its occupants. The Indians retaliated, killing 50 soldiers and civilians. Jackson reentered Florida in March 1818. According to Jackson's adjutant, Colonel Robert Butler, they "advanced on the Indian village called Tallahasse (sic) [where] two of the enemy were made prisoner."[15]


### State capital
Florida became an American territory in September 1821, in accordance with theAdams-Onís Treatyof 1819.
The first session of theLegislative Council of the Territory of Floridamet on July 22, 1822, at Pensacola, the former capital ofWest Florida. Members from St. Augustine, the former capital ofEast Florida, traveled 59 days by water to attend. The second session was in St. Augustine, and western delegates needed 28 days to travel perilously around the peninsula to reach St. Augustine. During this session, delegates decided to hold future meetings at a halfway point. Two appointed commissioners selected Tallahassee, then an Apalachee settlement (Anhaica) virtually abandoned afterAndrew Jackson burned it in 1818, as a halfway point. In 1824, the third legislative session met there in a crude log building serving as the capitol.[16]
From 1821 through 1845, during Florida's territorial period, the rough-hewn frontier capital gradually developed as a town. TheMarquis de Lafayette, French hero of the American Revolution, returned to the United States in 1824 for a tour. TheU.S. Congressvoted to give him $200,000 (the same amount he had given the colonies in 1778), US citizenship, and theLafayette Land Grant, 36 square miles (93 km2) of land that today includes large portions of Tallahassee. In 1845, aGreek revivalmasonry structure was erected as the Capitol building in time for statehood. Now known as the "old Capitol", it stands in front of the high-rise Capitol building built in the 1970s.[17]
Tallahassee was in the heart of Florida'sCotton Belt—Leon County led the state in cotton production—and was the center of theslave tradein Florida.[18]During theAmerican Civil War, Tallahassee was the only Confederate state capital east of theMississippi Rivernot captured by Union forces, and the only one not burned. A small engagement, theBattle of Natural Bridge, was fought south of the city on March 6, 1865, just a month before the war ended.
During the 19th century, the institutions that later developed intoFlorida State Universitywere established in Tallahassee; it became a university town. These included theTallahassee Female Academy(founded 1843) and the Florida Institute (founded 1854). In 1851, the Florida legislature decreed two seminaries be built on either side of theSuwannee River,East Florida SeminaryandWest Florida Seminary. In 1855, West Florida Seminary was transferred to the Florida Institute building (which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in Tallahassee). In 1858, the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy and became coeducational.[19]Its main building was near the northwest corner of South Copeland and West Jefferson streets, approximately where FSU'sWestcott Buildingis today.
In 1887, the Normal College for Colored Students, the ancestor of today'sFAMU, opened its doors. The legislature decided Tallahassee was the best location in Florida for a college serving African-American students; the state had segregated schools. Four years later, its name was changed toState Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students, to teach teachers for elementary school children and students in industrial skills.
After the Civil War, much of Florida's industry moved south and east, a trend that continues today. The end ofslaveryand the rise of free labor reduced the profitability of the cotton and tobacco trades, at a time when world markets were also changing. The state's major industries shifted to citrus, lumber,naval stores, cattle ranching, and tourism. The latter was increasingly important by the late 19th century. In the post-Civil War period, many formerplantationsin the Tallahassee area were purchased by wealthy northerners for use as winter hunting preserves. This included the hunting preserve of Henry L. Beadel, who bequeathed his land for the study of the effects of fire on wildlife habitat. Today the preserve is known as theTall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy, nationally recognized for its research intofire ecologyand the use ofprescribed burning.


### 1900–99
UntilWorld War II, Tallahassee remained a small Southern town with virtually the entire population living within one mile (1.6 km) of the Capitol.[citation needed]The main economic drivers were the colleges and state government, where politicians met to discuss spending money on grand public improvement projects to accommodate growth in places such as Miami and Tampa Bay, hundreds of miles away from the capital.
Tallahassee was also active in protest during thecivil rights era. TheTallahassee bus boycottwas a citywide boycott in Tallahassee, Florida that sought to end racial segregation in the employment and seating arrangements of city buses. On May 26, 1956, Florida A&M University students Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson were arrested by theTallahassee Police Departmentfor "placing themselves in a position to incite a riot". Robert Saunders, representing theNAACP, and Rev.C. K. Steelebegan talks with city authorities while the local African-American community started boycotting the city's buses. The Inter-Civic Council ended the boycott on December 22, 1956. On January 7, 1957, the City Commission repealed the bus-franchise segregation clause because of the United States Supreme Court rulingBrowder v. Gayle(1956). In the 1960s, there was a movement to transfer the capital toOrlando, closer to the state's growing population centers. That movement was defeated; the 1970s saw a long-term commitment by the state to the capital city, with the construction of the new capitol complex and preservation of the old Florida State Capitol building.[citation needed]
In 1970, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 74.0% white and 25.4% black.[20]In 1971, the city electedJames R. Fordto the 5-member City Commission, and he became the city's first African-American mayor in 1972 (commissioners rotated into the position serving a one-year term).
Bobby Bowdenbecame the head coach ofFlorida State Seminoles footballin 1976, and turned Tallahassee into a city dominated by college football. Bowden became very successful very quickly at Florida State. By his second year, Bowden had to deny rumors that he would leave for another job; the team went 9–2, compared to the four wins total in the three seasons before Bowden. During 34 years as head coach he had only one losing season–his first, in 1976.
In 1977, the 22-story high-riseCapitol building, designed by architectEdward Durell Stone, was completed. Since 2021, it has been the third-tallest state capitol building in the United States. In 1978, the Old Capitol, directly in front of the new Capitol, was scheduled for demolition, but state officials decided to keep it as a museum.[21]In 1986,Jack McLeanserved as mayor, the second African-American to hold the position.[22]


### 2000–present
Tallahassee was the center of world attention for six weeks during the2000 United States Presidential election recount, which involved numerous rulings by theFlorida Secretary of Stateand theFlorida Supreme Court.
Tallahassee has been impacted by many natural disasters, including a direct hit byHurricane Hermine, which caused about 80% of the city proper to lose power, includingFlorida State University;[23]Hurricane Michaelin 2018; andtwo EF2 tornadoesin 2024.[24]


### Geography
The approximate coordinates for the City of Tallahassee is located at30°27′18″N84°15′12″W﻿ / ﻿30.45500°N 84.25333°W﻿ /30.45500; -84.25333.
Tallahassee has an area of 98.2 square miles (254.3 km2), of which 95.7 square miles (247.9 km2) is land and 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), or 2.59%, is water.[25]
Tallahassee's terrain is hilly by Florida standards, being at the southern end of theRed Hills Region, just above theCody Scarp. The elevation varies from near sea level to just over 200 feet (61 m), with the state capitol on one of the highest hills in the city. The city includes two large lake basins,Lake JacksonandLake Lafayette, and borders the northern end of theApalachicola National Forest.
The flora and fauna are similar to those found in the mid-south and low country regions ofSouth CarolinaandGeorgia. The palm trees are the more cold-hardy varieties like the state tree, theSabal palmetto. Pines, magnolias, hickories, and a variety of oaks are the dominant trees. TheSouthern Live Oakis perhaps the most emblematic of the city.


### Nearby cities and suburbs


### Cityscape
Tallahassee has many neighborhoods inside the city limits. Some of the most known and defined include All Saints, Apalachee Ridge, Betton Hills, Buck Lake, Callen,Frenchtown(the oldest historically black neighborhood in the state),[26]Killearn Estates, Killearn Lakes Plantation, Lafayette Park, Levy Park,Los Robles, Midtown, Holly Hills, Jake Gaither/University Park, Indian Head Acres, Myers Park,Smokey Hollow,SouthWood, Seminole Manor and Woodland Drives.
Tallahassee is also home to somegated communities, including Golden Eagle, Ox Bottom, Lafayette Oaks, and The Preserve at San Luis; the Tallahassee Ranch Club is to the southeast of the city.


### Urban planning and expansion
The first plan for the Capitol Center was the 1947 Taylor Plan, which consolidated several government buildings in one downtown area. In 1974, the Capitol Center Planning Commission for the City of Tallahassee, Florida responded to growth of its urban center with a conceptual plan for the expansion of its Capitol Center.Hisham Ashkouri, working forThe Architects' Collaborative, led the urban planning and design effort. Estimating growth and related development for approximately the next 25 years, the program projected the need for 2.3 million square feet (214,000 m2) of new government facilities in the city core, with 3,500 dwelling units, 100 acres (40 ha) of new public open space, retail and private office space, and other ancillary spaces. Community participation was an integral part of the design review, welcoming Tallahassee residents to provide input as well as citizens' groups and government agencies, resulting in the creation of six separate design alternatives.[citation needed]


### Sprawl and compact growth
The Tallahassee-Leon County Planning Department implements policies aimed at promoting compact growth and development, including the establishment and maintenance of an Urban Service Area. The intent of the Urban Service Area is to "have Tallahassee and Leon County grow in a responsible manner, with infrastructure provided economically and efficiently, and surrounding forest and agricultural lands protected from unwarranted and premature conversion to urban land use."[28]The result of compact growth policies has been a significant overall reduction in the Sprawl Index for Tallahassee between 2000 and 2010.[29]CityLab reported on this finding, stating "Tallahassee laps the field, at least as far as the Sprawl Index is concerned."[30]


### Climate
Tallahassee has ahumid subtropical climate(Köppen:Cfa), with long, tropical summers and short, mild winters, as well as warm to hot, drier springs and autumns.  Tallahassee falls inUSDAhardiness zone9a (20 to 25 °F; −7 to −4 °C).[32]Summer maximum temperatures  are hotter than locations to the south on the Florida peninsula and it is one of the few cities in the state to occasionally record temperatures above 100 °F (37.8 °C); there are an average of 11.2 days per year that have temperatures at least that high.[33]The record high of 105 °F (41 °C) was set on June 15, 2011.[34]
Summer is characterized by brief intenseshowersandthunderstormsthat form along the afternoonsea breezefrom theGulf of Mexico. The daily mean temperature in July, the hottest month, is 82.9 °F (28.3 °C). Conversely, the winter is markedly cooler, with a January daily average temperature of 51.0 °F (10.6 °C).[31]There is an average of 34.6 nights with a minimum at or below freezing, and on average, the window for freezing temperatures is from November 22 thru March 16, allowing a growing season of 250 days.[31]With the data from the 1991–2020 normals, Tallahassee is in aUSDA 9a zoneby a small margin, the coldest temperature of the year usually being about 20.2 °F (−6.6 °C). Temperature readings below 15 °F (−9 °C) are very rare, having last occurred on January 11, 2010.[31]
During theGreat Blizzard of 1899the city reached −2 °F (−19 °C) on February 13, which remains Florida's only recorded subzero reading. The record cold daily maximum is 22 °F (−6 °C), set on the same day as the all-time record low. More recently, a 28 °F (−2 °C) daily maximum was recorded in 1985.[31]Conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 81 °F (27 °C) on July 15, 1980.[31]However, the city itself is considerably warmer than the airport where the National Weather Service records its data from, even though the National Weather Service does not record data from it. This is due to anurban heat island, which creates an average disparity of 5.8 °F (3.2 °C) and is especially pronounced during winter.[35][36][37]
Snow and ice are rare in Tallahassee, not occurring during most winters. Historically, snow flurries are recorded every three to four years, but measurable snowfall of 0.1 inches (0.3 cm) or more has only happened once in the 1991–2020 time period.  Tallahassee has recorded a few very small accumulating snowfalls over the last 100 years; the greatest amount was 2.8 inches (7 cm) on February 13, 1958.[38]Tallahassee's other recorded measurable snowfalls were 1.0 inch (2.5 cm) on February 12–13, 1899, andDecember 22–23, 1989; 0.4 inches (1.0 cm) on March 28, 1955, and February 10, 1973; 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) on February 2, 1951; 0.1 inches (0.3 cm) onJanuary 3, 2018;[38][39][40]and 1.9 incheson January 21–22, 2025.[41][42]
Although severalhurricaneshave brushed Tallahassee with their outer rain and wind bands, in recent years onlyHurricane Kate, in 1985, andHurricane Hermine, in 2016, have struck Tallahassee directly.Hurricane Michaelpassed 50 miles (80 km) to the west after making landfall nearMexico Beach, Floridain October 2018 as a Category 5 storm, resulting in 95% ofLeon Countybeing without power.
The Big Bend area of North Florida sees severaltornadoeseach year during the season, but they are generally weak, cause little structural damage, and rarely hit the city. On April 19, 2015, a tornado touched down in Tallahassee. The tornado was ratedEF1, and created a path as wide as 350 yards (320 m) for almost 5 miles (8 km) near Maclay Gardens.[43]Damage included numerous downed tree limbs and a car crushed by a falling tree. During extremely heavy rains, some low-lying parts of Tallahassee may flood, notably the Franklin Boulevard area adjacent to the downtown and the Killearn Lakes subdivision, outside the Tallahassee city limits, on the north side.
The most recent tornadoes to hit the city were EF2s on May 10, 2024. One of them hit downtown Tallahassee, being 1,400 yards (1,300 m) wide.

### Law, government and politics


### Politics
Tallahassee has traditionally been aDemocraticcity, but the party has been supported by different ethnic groups over time, with a major shift in the late 20th century. Leon County has voted Democratic in 24 of the past 29 presidential elections since 1904. But until the late 1960s, most African Americans weredisenfranchisedfrom the political system, dating fromJim Crow lawspassed by Democrats in Florida (and in all other Southern states) at the turn of the century. At that time, most African Americans were affiliated with theRepublican Party, and their disenfranchisement resulted in that party being non-competitive in the region for decades. Subsequently, these demographic groups traded party alignments in the 1960s and 1970s.
Since passage of theVoting Rights Act of 1965and enforcement of constitutional rights for African Americans, voters in Tallahassee have elected black mayors and black state representatives.[59]: 97It has become a city in theSouthern U.S.that is known forprogressiveactivism.[citation needed]This is likely due to the fact that Tallahassee and Leon County havethe highest level of college graduates in the state. In addition, in the realignment of party politics since the late 20th century, most of the African-American population in the city now support Democratic Party candidates.[60][61]
As of December 2, 2018, there were 112,572 Democrats, 58,083 Republicans, and 44,007 voters who were independent or had other affiliations among the 214,662 voters inLeon County.[62]

### Consolidation
Voters of Leon County have gone to thepollsfour times to vote onconsolidationof Tallahassee and Leon County governments into one jurisdiction combining police and other city services with already shared (consolidated)Tallahassee Fire DepartmentandLeon County Emergency Medical Services. Tallahassee's city limits would increase from 103.1 square miles (267 km2) to 702 square miles (1,820 km2). Roughly 36 percent of Leon County's 265,714 residents live outside the Tallahassee city limits.
Each time, the measure was rejected:[73]
The proponents of consolidation have stated the new jurisdiction would attract business by its size. Merging governments would cut government waste, duplication of services, etc. However, Professor Richard Feiock of the Department of Public Administration ofKorea Universityand theAskew School of Public Administration and PolicyofFlorida State Universitystates that no discernible relationship exists between consolidation and the local economy.[74]


### Flag
The former flag of Tallahassee was vaguely similar to theflag of Florida, a whitesaltireon a blue field, with the city's coat of arms, featuring the cupola of theold capitol building, at the center. The flag is an homage to the Scottish and Ulster-Scots Presbyterian heritage of the original founders of the city, most of whom were settlers from North Carolina whose ancestors had either come to America directly from Scotland, or were Presbyterians of Scottish descent fromCounty DownandCounty Antrimin what has since becomeNorthern Ireland.[75]The current flag incorporates a stylized 5-point star and the city name on a white background.[76]

To gauge performance the State of Florida rates all public schools according to student achievement on the state-sponsored Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT). Seventy-nine percent of Leon County Public Schools received an A or B grade in the 2008–2009 school year. The overall district grade assigned to the Leon County Schools is "A". Students in the Leon County School District continued to score favorably in comparison to Florida and national averages in the SAT and ACT student assessment tests.
