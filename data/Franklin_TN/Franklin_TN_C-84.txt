The city developed on both sides of the [[Harpeth River]], a tributary of the [[Cumberland River]]. In the 19th century, Franklin (as the county seat) was the trading and judicial center for primarily rural Williamson County and remained so well into the 20th century as the county remained rural and agricultural in nature.

Since 1980, areas of northern Franklin have been developed for residential and related businesses, in addition to modern service industries. The population has increased rapidly as growth moved in all directions from the core. Despite recent growth and development, Franklin is noted for its many older buildings and neighborhoods, which are protected by city ordinances.<ref>[https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2017/11/05/franklin-tennessee-preservation-heritage-foundation-carnton-plantation/764919001/ How Franklin has preserved history for 50 years] (''USA Today'')</ref>

== History ==

===18th century===
The City of Franklin was founded October 26, 1799, by Abram Maury Jr. (1766–1825). Later a state senator, he is buried with his family in the current Founders Pointe neighborhood.

Ewen Cameron built a log house in 1798, the first in the new settlement. Cameron was born February 23, 1768, in Bogallan, [[Ferintosh, Black Isle|Ferintosh]], [[Scotland]]. He emigrated to [[Virginia]] in 1785 and came to Tennessee shortly after it was admitted to the Union.  Cameron died on February 28, 1846, after living 48 years in the same house. He and his second wife, Mary, were buried in the old City Cemetery. Some of his descendants continue to live in Franklin.

===19th century===
This area is part of [[Middle Tennessee]], and farmers prospered in the [[Pre-Civil War South|pre-Civil]] War years, with the cultivation of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and raising of livestock.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Tennessee was occupied by Union troops from 1862. Franklin was the site of a major battle in the [[Franklin–Nashville Campaign]]. The [[Second Battle of Franklin]] was fought on November 30, 1864, resulting in almost 10,000 casualties (killed, wounded, captured, and missing). Forty-four buildings were temporarily converted to use as [[field hospital]]s. The Carter, Carnton, and the [[Lotz House|Lotz]]<ref name=nris>{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref> houses from this era are still standing and are among the city's numerous examples of period architecture.

On July 6, 1867, a political rally of [[Union League]] Black Republicans in Franklin was disrupted by Conservatives, who were mostly White but included some Blacks. Later that evening, what became known as the "Franklin Riot" broke out. Black Union League men were ambushed by Whites at the town square and returned fire. An estimated 25 to 39 men were wounded, most of them Black. One White man was killed outright, and at least three Black people died of wounds soon after the confrontation.<ref name="memphisappeal">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf "Riot at Franklin, Tennessee"], ''Memphis Daily Appeal'', 9 July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref><ref name="nashville">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf "Conservative Conciliation/The Ballot to be Controlled by the Bullet"], ''Nashville Daily Press and Times'', July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref><ref name="nyt">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf "A Riot in Tennessee"], ''New York Times'', 8 July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref>

On August 15, 1868, in Franklin, [[Samuel Bierfield]] became the first Jewish man to be [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in the United States. He was fatally shot by a large group of masked men believed to be KKK members. They attacked him for treating Blacks equally to Whites in his store. Bowman, a Black man who worked for Bierfield and was with him at his store, was wounded in the attack and soon died.<ref name=for>"[http://forward.com/articles/210334/midnight-in-tennessee Midnight in Tennessee]", Paul Berger, [[The Jewish Daily Forward|Forward.com]], December 12, 2014</ref>

After the [[Reconstruction era]], violence continued against [[African Americans]], rising toward the turn of the century. Five African Americans were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in Williamson County from 1877 to 1950, most during the decades around the turn of the century, a time of high social tensions and legal racial oppression in the South.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/Summary by County (3rd edition)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, p. 9, Equal Justice Initiative, 2017, Montgomery, Alabama</ref><ref name="supp">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America/ Supplement: Lynchings by County''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, Equal Justice Initiative, 2017, 3rd edition, p. 6</ref> These murders took place in Franklin, when men were taken from the courthouse or county jail before trial. Among them was [[Lynching of Amos Miller|Amos Miller]], a 23-year-old Black man who was forcibly taken from the courtroom by a White mob during his 1888 trial in a sexual assault case, and hanged from the railings of the balcony of the county courthouse.<ref name="berger">{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=Paul|title=Midnight in Tennessee – The Untold Story of the First Jewish Lynching in America|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/the-untold-story-of-the-first-jewish-lynching-in-america-1.5349605|access-date=May 15, 2018|work=Haaretz|date=December 20, 2014|quote=In 1888, Amos Miller, a Black man accused of raping a White woman, was dragged from court in Franklin and hung from the courthouse railings.}}</ref> The alleged victim was a 50-year-old woman.<ref>[https://visitfranklin.com/see-and-do/old-williamson-county-courthouse-public-square "Old Williamson County Courthouse - Public Square"], Visit Franklin website</ref> On April 30, 1891, [[Lynching of Jim Taylor|Jim Taylor]], another African American man, was lynched on Murfreesboro Road in Franklin by another mob, accused of killing a White man.

A [[Confederate Monument (Franklin, Tennessee)|memorial to Confederate soldiers]] was erected in 1899 by fourteen women of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] to honor Confederate soldiers, including the 6,125 casualties of the Battle of Franklin.<ref name="Jones">{{cite web|url=https://usctwillcotn.blogspot.com/2019/11/franklins-confederate-monument.html/|title=From Slaves to Soldiers and Beyond - Williamson County, Tennessee's African American History|last=Jones|first=Cahalan|work=Slaves to Soldiers|date=30 November 2019|access-date=31 July 2020}}</ref> A news report described how as the last piece of the statue was being raised, a buggy ran into a rope, causing the statue to swing into the shaft, breaking out a piece from the hat of the figure.

===20th century to present===
Population growth slowed noticeably from 1910 to 1940 (see table in Demographics section), as many African Americans left the area in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern industrial cities for jobs and to escape [[Jim Crow]] conditions.

One of the first major manufacturers to establish operations in the county was the [[Dortch Stove Works]], which opened a factory in Franklin in 1928.<ref name=FactoryFranklin>"[http://www.williamsonherald.com/editorial/hudson-alexanders-around-the-block-dortch-stove-works-helped-franklin-through-depression/article_56ef2d61-f7e5-5456-927b-b2fb07c80781.html Hudson Alexander's Around the Block: Dortch Stove Works helped Franklin through Depression ]", Hudson Alexander, [[The Williamson Herald|http://www.williamsonherald.com/]], March 16, 2006</ref> The factory was later developed as a [[Magic Chef]] factory, producing electric and gas ranges. (Magic Chef was prominent in the Midwest from 1929.) When the factory was closed due to extensive restructuring in the industry, the structure fell into disuse. The factory complex was restored in the late 1990s in an adaptation for offices, restaurants, retail and event spaces. It is considered a "model historic preservation adaptive reuse project."

Since the late 20th century, however, Franklin has rapidly developed as a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee. Franklin's population has increased more than fivefold since 1980, when its population was 12,407. In 2010, the city had a population of 62,487.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4727740| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001), Franklin city, Tennessee| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American FactFinder| access-date=March 18, 2019| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213091053/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4727740| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> {{as of|2017}} Census estimates, it is the state's seventh-largest city. In 2017, the City of Franklin was ranked the 8th fastest-growing city in the nation by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], increasing 4.9 percent between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2017.<ref name="Franklin city, TN">{{cite web |title=United States Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/franklincitytennessee/PST045218 |website=United States Census Bureau-Quick Facts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref>

After the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966, some Franklin residents have worked to identify and preserve its most significant historic assets. Five [[historic districts]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], as are many individual non-historic but older structures.

Franklin is home to an armed forces memorial, on the grounds of the Williamson County Archives, which honors Williamson County servicemen who served in American wars from the [[Creek War]] to the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="Archives Memorial">{{cite web|url=https://visitfranklin.com/see-and-do/williamson-county-veterans-park-and-cannon-located-on-the-grounds-of-williamson-county|title=Williamson County Veterans' Park And Cannon (Located On The Grounds Of Williamson County Archives)|work=Visit Franklin|date=21 July 2020|access-date=21 July 2020}}</ref> Around the seal of Franklin are placed engraved bricks that radiate around it in a circle. The largest brick is in honor of George Jordan, a former slave who fought in the [[Indian Wars]] in [[New Mexico]], and the only Williamson Countian to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.

As part of the "Fuller Story," a plan developed by historic preservation and church leaders to recognize the lives and contributions of African Americans to Franklin, a statue of a soldier of the [[United States Colored Troops]], to mark the contributions of African Americans in ending the Civil War and reuniting the Union, has been placed in front of the old Williamson County Courthouse on the Franklin Square, the site of a former slave market and the current "Chip" statue.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=McGee|first1=Jamie|last2=Maney|first2=Sarahbeth|date=2021-10-24|title=Remove a Confederate Statue?
