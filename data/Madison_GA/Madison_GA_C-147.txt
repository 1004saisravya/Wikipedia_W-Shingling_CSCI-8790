History

Madison was described in an early 19th-century issue of White's Statistics of Georgia as "the most cultured and aristocratic town on the stagecoach route from Charleston to New Orleans." In an 1849 edition of White's Statistics of Georgia, the following was written about Madison: "In point of intelligence, refinement, and hospitality, this town acknowledges no superior." On December 12, 1809, the town, named for 4th United States president, James Madison, was incorporated.


While many believe that Sherman spared the town because it was too beautiful to burn during his March to the Sea, the truth is that Madison was home to pro-Union Congressman (later Senator) Joshua Hill. Hill had ties with General William Tecumseh Sherman's brother in the House of Representatives, so his sparing the town was more political than appreciation of its beauty.


In 1895 Madison was reported to have an oil mill with a capital of $35,000, a soap factory, a fertilizer factory, four steam ginneries, a mammoth compress, two carriage factories, a furniture factory, a grist and flouringmill, a bottling works, a distillery with a capacity of 120 gallons a day, an ice factory with a capital of $10,500, a canning factory with a capital of $10,000, a bank with a capital of $75,000, surplus $12,000, and a number of small industries operated by individual enterprise.


Against the backdrop of this Jim Crow-era prosperity, white Madisonians participated in at least three documented lynchings of African Americans. In February of 1890, after a rushed trial involving knife-wielding jurors, a Mr. Brown Washington was found guilty of the murder of a 9-year-old local white girl. After the verdict, though the sheriff, with the governor’s approval, called up the Madison Home Guard to protect Mr. Washington, “only three militiamen and none of the officers”  responded to the order. Mr. Washington was thus easily taken from jail by a posse of ten men organized by a “leading local businessman.” Described as “among the best citizens,” they promptly handed Mr. Washington over to a mob waiting outside the courthouse. From there, he was taken to a telegraph pole, allowed a prayer, then strung up and shot, his body mutilated by more than a hundred bullets. Afterwards, in the patriarchal exhibition-style common of southern lynchings, a sign was posted on the telegraph pole: “Our women and children will be protected.”  His body was not taken down until noon the next day.


According to Brundage's account in Lynching in the New South: Georgia and Virginia, 1880-1930:


“The open participation of men ‘of all ages and standing in life,’ the carefully organized public meeting that planned the mob’s course of action, the obvious complicity of the militia, and the ritualized execution of Washington all highlight the degree to which the lynching was sanctioned by the community at large. Shared attitudes toward women, sexuality, and black criminality, combined with local bonds of community and family, focused the fears and rage of whites on Washington and guaranteed mass involvement in his execution.” 


In the aftermath, though local and state authorities vowed to thoroughly investigate the lynching as well as the Madison Home Guard’s dereliction of duty,  just a week later a grand jury was advised by a judge of the superior court of Madison that any investigation would be a waste of time. In addition, the state body charged with investigating the home guard’s non-response reported that their absence had been satisfactorily explained and no tribunal would be convened to investigate the matter.” 


Although the local Madisonian newspaper failed to report on the 1890 extra-judicial murder of Mr. Washington, an even earlier first lynching by Madisonians of a man they similarly pulled out of the old stone county jail appears in the contemporary accounts from the Atlanta Constitution. 


In 1919, ten years after the erection of a Lost Cause memorial in front of the newly-built Morgan County courthouse, a third lynching occurred. This time, citizens skipped the show-trials altogether, opting to travel to the home of Mr. Wallace Baynes and execute him in the dark of night a few days before Thanksgiving. Afterwards, the sheriff present at the lynching said he could not identify any of the men who came for Mr. Baynes, despite the fact that they arrived in cars, lit up Mr. Baynes' home with the headlights of their vehicles, and shot him in a volley of gunfire. In an editorial that argued that mobs in the south were no worse than mobs in the north yet condemned future lynchings, the local Madisonian claimed: “There is not now and perhaps will never be, any friction between the races here.” 


The Lost Cause monument erected in 1909 by the Morgan County Daughters of the Confederacy in front of the courthouse where Mr. Baynes was not afforded a trial was inscribed in part: "NO NATION ROSE/SO WHITE AND FAIR, NONE FELL SO PURE OF CRIME." In the 1950s the monument was moved to Hill Park, a Madison city property named for Joshua Hill, the aforementioned pro-Union senator who before the civil war resigned his position rather than support secession.


Madison has one of the largest historic districts in the state of Georgia, and tourists from all over the world come to marvel at the antebellum architecture of the homes.
