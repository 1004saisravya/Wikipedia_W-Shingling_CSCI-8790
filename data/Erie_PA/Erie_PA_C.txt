Erie is a city on the south shore of Lake Erie and the county seat of Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the fifth-most populous city in Pennsylvania and the most populous in Northwestern Pennsylvania with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census. The two-county Erie metropolitan area had a population of 270,876 in 2020. Erie is about  from Buffalo,  from Cleveland, and  from Pittsburgh.
The city takes its name from the Native American Erie people, who inhabited the area until the mid-17th century. Its nicknames include "Gem City", a reference to its fine natural harbor, the "Gem of the Great Lakes"; and more recently, "Flagship City", from a local marketing effort to play up the homeport of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship Niagara.
Part of the Rust Belt, Erie has seen manufacturing decline as a share of its economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism have grown. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.
==History==
Indigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township, west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.
Europeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term presque-isle means "almost an island". When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.History of Erie County, p. 503.
Erie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.
===18th century===
The Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9, 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.Nelson, pp. 103−104.
The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year.History of Erie County, pp 505−506. Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in what is now Presque Isle.
===19th century===
President James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led the construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic Battle of Lake Erie."History of Erie County", pp. 299, 306.
Erie was a significant hub for shipbuilding, fishing, and railroads during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. Although the delays caused cargo problems for commerce and travel, they created much-needed local jobs in Erie. When officials proposed a standardized gauge, the change threatened those jobs and the rail hub's significance. During the resulting Erie Gauge War, Erie's citizens—led by the mayor—set fire to bridges, tore up tracks, and rioted to prevent the standardization.
===20th and 21st centuries===
On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed underneath more than  of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.
Erie continued to grow for the first half of the 20th century, due to its strong manufacturing base. The city attracted numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie was considered a wet city during the Prohibition Era in the United States. The city's economy declined in the latter part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring led to job losses in the area. Analysts from institutions such as the Brookings Institution, the Federal Reserve, and regional media like WESA FM classify the Erie region as part of the Rust Belt.Berube, Alan. "Erie's Rust Belt activism." Brookings, September 16, 2019. https://www.brookings.edu/articles/eries-rust-belt-activism/Schiller, Zach. "Urban Decline in Rust-Belt Cities." Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, June 1, 2013. https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2013/ec-201306-urban-decline-in-rust-belt-citiesLitke, Eric. "Eager to shake its Rust Belt designation, Erie is a profile of redefinition." WESA, October 29, 2020. https://www.wesa.fm/development-transportation/2020-10-29/eager-to-shake-its-rust-belt-designation-erie-is-a-profile-of-redefinition The importance of American manufacturing, U.S. steel and coal production, and commercial fishing began to decline gradually, resulting in a significant population downturn in the 1970s.
With the advent of the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek Township, which now has 55,000 residents.  This caused a decline in downtown retail businesses, some of which moved to the suburbs. Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as "The Mistake on the Lake" or "Dreary Erie".

* Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market.
Erie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009.  In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200, a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.
==Geography==
Erie is situated in Northwestern Pennsylvania at  (42.114507, -80.076213), on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is  northeast of Cleveland, Ohio,  southwest of Buffalo, New York, and  north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.  Lake Erie is about  above sea level, while the city of Erie is about  above sea level.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with  being land and the remaining , or 1.03%, being water. Presque Isle State Park (referred to by locals as "the Peninsula" or simply "the beach"), is a recurving sandspit peninsula that stretches north into Lake Erie, providing a fine, natural harbor for Erie and offers  of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.
Erie fronts Presque Isle Bay and is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area. The downtown area is separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway. The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at , and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at . Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, located on the west side of Erie, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.
Post-industrial redevelopment of Erie's waterfront aimed at recreational and tourism uses include the Bayfront Parkway, Niagara Pier, Perry's Landing Marina, Liberty Park & Amphitheater, Bayfront Convention Center, hotels, and Dobbins Landing, which features the Bicentennial Tower at its northern end. On the east side of the bayfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the Erie County main library (third-largest in Pennsylvania) host the USS Niagara. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.

===Religion===
In the early 20th century, Erie had a significant community of Russian immigrants, many of whom worked in shipbuilding along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were priestless (Bespopovtsy) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Father Pimen Simon became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church. Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.

==Economy==
Erie is Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after the American Revolution and later became a railroad hub during the significant American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century with firms such as Griswold Manufacturing, once the leader in cast-iron cookware.
Since the decline of large manufacturers in the late 20th century, a more diverse mix of mid-sized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants (with about 10% of tooling and molding located in the tri-state area) and vigorous service sectors: health, insurance, and tourism. The ZIP code 16501, which covers some of the downtown areas, is considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.
Erie is the corporate headquarters of the Erie Insurance Group and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was founded and has significant operations in Erie. Along with WABTEC and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county include the county, state, and federal governments, as well as the Erie City School District.

In August 2019, the Discovery Channel filmed Undercover Billionaire in Erie. The series followed billionaire Glenn Stearns as "Glenn Bryant," arriving with $100, a cell phone, and an old pickup truck to build a $1 million business in 90 days. He founded Underdog BBQ in Erie, which still operates. Independent appraisers valued the business at around $750,000—short of the $1 million goal—leading Stearns to invest $1 million of his funds and appoint key local collaborators to leadership roles.
In January 2021, Discovery aired the spin-off Undercover Billionaire: Comeback City, where Stearns returned to Erie to help rescue six struggling local businesses—including Tipsy Bean, Dominick's Diner, TKO Erie, and Lake Erie Rubber—within 27 days each. Stearns described the series as "a teaching show," emphasizing mentorship and sustainable turnaround rather than a quick fix.

The western terminus for I-86, also called the "Southern Tier Expressway", is at I-90 near Harborcreek, between Erie and North East. I-86 continues east through New York to Binghamton. The Bayfront Connector runs from I-90 in Harborcreek to the Bayfront Parkway and Downtown Erie, along the east side of the city, then connects to I-79 on the west side of the city. Major thoroughfares in the city include 12th Street, 26th Street, 38th Street, and Peach Street. Peach is also a part of  U.S. 19, whose northern terminus is in Erie and continues south, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Several major routes run through Erie. PA 5, also known as the Seaway Trail, follows portions of 6th Street, 8th Street, 12th Street, and East Lake Road within the city. U.S. 20 runs along 26th Street.

The former "Water Level Route" of the New York Central Railroad travels directly through Erie. It is now the mainline for CSX freight trains. The main line of the Norfolk Southern Railway, originally built by the Nickel Plate Railroad, also travels through Erie. Norfolk Southern trains once ran down the middle of 19th Street, but crews removed the tracks in 2002.

The city of Erie and northwest Pennsylvania lie within area code 814. On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012. The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review its decision and ordered additional public input hearings and technical conferences in response to the strong public outcry. In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.
