History
[
edit
]


For a chronological guide, see 
Timeline of Boulder, Colorado
.


Archaeological evidence shows that Boulder Valley has been continuously inhabited by Native American tribes for over 13,000 years, beginning in the late Pleistocene era. Throughout the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, Indigenous peoples moved seasonally between the mountains and plains, taking shelter in winter along the Front Range trough where Boulder now lies. By the 1500s, the area was occupied by Ute tribes, joined by Arapaho tribes in the early 1800s.
[
10
]


The Indigenous Nations who have ties to the Boulder Valley include the 
Apache
, 
Arapaho
, 
Cheyenne
, 
Comanche
, 
Kiowa
, 
Pawnee
, 
Shoshone
, 
Sioux
, and 
Ute
 peoples. In the 1800s, Euro-American settlers colonized the area.
[
11
]


Modern Boulder was founded in late 1858 when prospectors led by Thomas Aikins arrived at Boulder Canyon during the Colorado Gold Rush. Arapaho leader Niwot allowed them to stay for the winter, but the settlers abused this peaceful approach, and some later took part in the 
Sand Creek massacre
 of Arapaho.
[
12
]
 In early 1859, gold was discovered along Boulder Creek, drawing more miners and merchants to the area. The Boulder City Town Company was formed in February 1859 to establish a settlement at the canyon mouth. By 1860, it had 70 cabins, occupied mainly by Anglo families. Non-whites like Chinese miners and black residents were part of early Boulder but rarely pictured.
[
13
]


In 1861, Boulder County was created, and the Arapaho were forced to relocate per the Treaty of Fort Wise. With declining numbers, Niwot's band soon moved to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation. By 1862, the creek had yielded $100,000 in gold, and Boulder's population exceeded 300.

On November 7, 1861, the 
Colorado General Assembly
 passed legislation to locate the University of Colorado in Boulder.
[
14
]
 On September 20, 1875, the first cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main) on the CU campus. The university officially opened on September 5, 1877.
[
15
]


In 1907, Boulder adopted an anti-
saloon
 ordinance.
[
16
]
 In 1916, statewide 
prohibition
 started in Colorado, and ended with the repeal of national prohibition in 1933.

Housing
[
edit
]


Median home prices rose 60% from 2010 to 2015 to $648,200.
[
18
]
 In 2024, the City Council of Boulder repealed a long-standing law that prevented Boulder from increasing new residential units by more than 1% in a year.
[
19
]


In 1959, city voters approved the "Blue Line" city-charter amendment, which restricted city water service to altitudes below 5,750 feet (1,750 m), to protect the mountain backdrop from development. In 1967, city voters approved a dedicated sales tax to acquire open space to contain 
urban sprawl
. In 1970, Boulder created a "comprehensive plan" to dictate future zoning, transportation, and urban planning decisions. Hoping to preserve residents' views of the mountains, in 1972, the city enacted an ordinance limiting the height of newly constructed buildings. In 1974, a Historic Preservation Code was passed. In 1976, a 
residential-growth management
 ordinance, the Danish Plan, was passed.

Geography
[
edit
]


Boulder's rock formations, the 
Flatirons


The city of Boulder is located in the Boulder Valley, where the 
Rocky Mountains
 meet the 
Great Plains
. The 
Flatirons
, slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, are located west of the city and are a widely recognized symbol of Boulder.
[

Boulder Creek
 is the primary flow of water through Boulder. The creek was named before the city's founding for all of the large granite boulders that have cascaded into the creek over the eons.
[

]
 It is from Boulder Creek that the city is believed to have taken its name.
[
citation needed
]
 Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city.
[
citation needed
]
 The creek flows into 
St. Vrain Creek
 east of 
Longmont
, which is a tributary of the 
South Platte River
.

At the 
2020 United States Census
, the city had a total area of 17,514 acres (70.877 km
2
), including 664 acres (2.689 km
2
) of water.
[

]


The 
40th parallel
, 40 degrees north latitude, runs through Boulder and can be easily recognized as 
Baseline Road
 today.

Boulder lies in a wide basin beneath 
Flagstaff Mountain
 just a few miles east of the continental divide and about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Denver. Arapahoe Glacier provides water for the city, along with Boulder Creek, which flows through the center of the city.
[
23
]


Denver International Airport
 is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Boulder.
[
24
]




Environment
[
edit
]


In 1899, government preservation of open space around Boulder began, with the 
Congress of the United States
 approving the allocation of 1,800 acres (7.3 km
2
) of mountain backdrop/watershed extending from South Boulder Creek to Sunshine Canyon.



Wildlife protection
[
edit
]


Boulder has created an Urban Wildlife Management Plan which sets policies for managing and protecting urban wildlife.
[
25
]
 The city's Parks and Recreation and Open Space and Mountain Parks departments have volunteers who monitor parks, including wetlands, lakes, etc., to protect ecosystems.
[
26
]
 From time to time, parks and hiking trails are closed to conserve or restore ecosystems.
[
27
]

Traditionally, Boulder has avoided using chemical 
pesticides
 to control the insect population. However, with the threat of 
West Nile virus
, the city began an integrative plan
[
28
]
 to control the mosquito population in 2003 that includes chemical pesticides. Residents can opt out of the program by contacting the city and asking that their areas not be sprayed.
[
29
]


Under Boulder law, exterminating 
prairie dogs
 requires a permit.
[
30
]


In 2005, the city experimented with using goats for weed control in environmentally sensitive areas. Goats naturally consume diffuse 
knapweed
 and 
Canada thistle
, and although the program was not as effective as it was hoped, goats will still be considered in future weed control projects. In 2010, goats were used to keep weeds under control at the Boulder Reservoir.
[
31
]


The city's Open Space and Mountain Parks department manages approximately 8,000 acres (32 km
2
) of protected forest land west of the city, in accordance with a 1999 Forest Ecosystem Management Plan. The plan aims to maintain or enhance native plant and animal species, their communities, the ecological processes that sustain them and to reduce the wildfire risk to forest and human communities.

Autumn in Boulder


Snowfall is common in Boulder throughout the winter.


Boulder has a temperate climate typical for much of the state and receives many sunny or mostly sunny days each year. Boulder is considered 
semi-arid
 (Köppen: 
BSk
) or 
humid subtropical
 (Köppen: 
Cfa
) within the 
Köppen climate classification
 due to its relatively high yearly precipitation and average temperatures remaining above 32 °F (0 °C) year-round.
[
33
]
[
34
]
[
35
]
[
36
]


Winter conditions range from generally mild to the occasional bitterly cold. Highs average in the mid to upper 40s °F (7–9 °C). There are 4.6 nights annually where the temperature drops to 0 °F (−18 °C). Because of 
orographic lift
, the mountains to the west often dry out the air passing over the 
Front Range
, shielding the city from precipitation in winter, though heavy snowfalls may occur. Snowfall averages 88 inches (220 cm) per season. Snow depth is usually shallow. Due to the high elevation, a strong warming sun can quickly melt snow cover during the day and 
Chinook winds
 bring rapid warm-ups throughout the winter months.
[
37
]


Summers are warm, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. There are roughly 30 days of 90 °F (32 °C) or above each year.
[
37
]
 
Diurnal temperature variation
 is typically large due to the high elevation and semi-arid climate. Daytime highs are generally cooler than those of most Colorado cities with similar elevations. Boulder's nighttime lows are mild, particularly during winter. The average January temperature of 34.5 °F (1.4 °C) is the warmest of any city in the state.
[
38
]


The highest recorded temperature of 104 °F (40 °C) was on June 25, 2012.
[
39
]
 The record low was −33 °F (−36 °C) on January 17, 1930. The coldest high temperature, −12 °F (−24 °C), was on February 4, 1989. The warmest overnight low was on July 20, 1998, with a temperature of 82 °F (28 °C)

Boulder's main daily newspaper, the 
Daily Camera
, was founded in 1890 as the weekly 
Boulder Camera
, and became a daily newspaper in 1891. The 
Colorado Daily
 was started in 1892 as a university newspaper for CU Boulder. Following many heated controversies over

's
 political coverage, it severed its ties to the university in 1971. From 1996 to 2000, the 
Boulder Planet
 competed with the

The city from northbound US 36 as the highway descends into Boulder


Since Boulder has operated under residential growth control ordinances since 1976, the growth of employment in the city has far outstripped population growth. Considerable road traffic enters the city each morning and leaves each afternoon, since many employees live in 
Longmont
, 
Lafayette
, 
Louisville
, 
Broomfield
, 
Westminster
, and 
Denver
. Boulder is served by 
US 36
 and a variety of state highways. Parking regulations in Boulder have been explicitly designed to discourage parking by commuters and to encourage the use of mass transit, with mixed results.
[

]


Over the years, Boulder has made significant investments in the multi-modal network. The city is now well known for its grade-separated bicycle and pedestrian paths, which are integrated into a network of bicycle lanes, cycle tracks, and on-street bicycle routes. Boulder provides a community transit network that connects downtown, the University of Colorado campuses, and local shopping amenities. Boulder has no rail transit. Local and regional shuttle busses are funded by a variety of sources. Due in part to these investments in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure, Boulder has been recognized both nationally and internationally for its transportation system.

A 41-mile (66 km) RTD 
commuter rail
 route called the Northwest Rail Line, also known as the 
B Line
, is proposed to run from Denver through Boulder to 
Longmont
, with stops in major communities along the way. The Boulder station is to be north of Pearl Street and east of 30th Street. At one time this commuter rail service was scheduled to commence in 2014, but major delays have ensued. In 2016, an initial 6-mile (9.7 km) segment opened, reaching from downtown Denver to southern 
Westminster
 at 
Westminster Station
.
[
107
]
 The remaining 35 miles (56 km) of the Northwest Rail Line is planned to be completed by 2044, depending upon funding.
[
108
]


These future transit plans, as well as the current Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit route, are part of 
FasTracks
, an RTD transit improvement plan funded by a 0.4% increase in the sales tax throughout the Denver metro area. 
RTD
, the developer of FasTracks, is partnering with the city of Boulder to plan a 
transit-oriented development
 near Pearl and 33rd Streets in association with the proposed Boulder commuter rail station. The development is to feature the 
Boulder Railroad Depot
, already relocated to that site, which may be returned to a transit-related use.
