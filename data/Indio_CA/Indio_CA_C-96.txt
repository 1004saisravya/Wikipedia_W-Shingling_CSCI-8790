Indio, California
, is a 
U.S.
 city located in the 
Coachella Valley
 of Southern California's 
desert
 region.  The population was 49,116 at the 2000 census. According to the book 
History of the Coachella Valley Water District
, the word indio is Spanish for 
Indian.

Indio has hosted the 
Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
 since 
1999
 as well as other regularly-scheduled festivals.  Notable among these are the 
Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival
 held each February and the 
Indio International Tamale Festival
[1]
 held each December.  The largest festival of its kind in the US, the Tamale Festival earned Indio the official nickname of "The City Of Festivals." Indio is the site of the annual 
Southwest Arts Festival
 
[2]
 in the Empire Polo Club.

Indio is one of Southern California's most important agricultural regions as well, responsible for an overwhelming percentage of the nation's date crop. The city's nurseries produce a large share of the nation's 
palm trees
, as well. Travelers from around the world stop by 
Shields' Date Gardens
 
[3]
, the most famous of date growers maintains a square-mile area to grow them.  

History and transportation
[
edit
]

The town was laid out in 
1894
 by A.G. Tingman, a 
Southern Pacific Railroad
 construction boss. Tingman was also Indio's first storekeeper and postmaster.  Indio was chosen as a railroad stop because it was the halfway point between 
Los Angeles
 and 
Yuma, Arizona
.
Tingman Avenue, once downtown Indio's main street was named in his honor; it was removed during the construction of a highway overpass on Jackson Street designed to eliminate a railroad grade crossing and traffic congestion along Indio Boulevard (old Highway 99, which see). Another over-the-track bridge, Auto Center (now Golf Center) Drive, an extension of 
California State Route 111
 opened in 1977, and the Monroe Street bridge opened in 1989.   

Today, the Southern Pacific's successor, the 
Union Pacific Railroad
 maintains that original rail corridor as the main transcontinental line between Los Angeles and 
New Orleans, Louisiana
.  Indio's growth over the years was attributable both to the railroad and the coming of 
U.S. Highway 99
 in 
1926
.  Once California's main north-south highway, US 99 was decommissioned in 
1964
.  Its present-day replacements are California State Highway 111, 
California State Highway 86
 and 
Interstate 10
. But locals still used Indio Blvd., declared "Historic Route US 99" in 2001.

The original 
1903
 railroad station, a two-story wooden structure unique to the Southern Pacific, burned to the ground in 
1966
. Some of the station's artifacts were salvaged and can be viewed at the Coachella Valley Museum and Cultural Center in downtown Indio. The Southern Pacific rail depot is on the NE corner of Indio Blvd. and Jackson Street, but the railroad's regional headquarters moved to 
Colton
 near 
San Bernardino, California
 in 1990. The other major business in Indio was the  
Giannini Research Institute
 moved in 1967, but closed in 1985.

The aforementioned present-day Indio Boulevard was the site of the world's first use of a painted line to delineate lanes of traffic and was spearheaded by Dr. 
June McCarroll
 for whom a stretch of 
Interstate 10
 through the city is named. The I-10 was constructed in the mid-1970's when Indio was smaller, so the route bypasses the city and as a result, drivers didn't go down to downtown Indio like in the past and business activity declined in the 1980's and 1990's. Today, Indio is growing and developed the area by I-10 and more drivers noticed the city, so they take an off-ramp.

Bermuda Dunes Airport (FAA designator: UDD) has a 5,000 foot runway and is on the north-western border of Indio, serves small private planes, air carriers and commuter jets. The 
Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport
 in 
Thermal
 is named for the famous 1920's pilot and Indio resident and used for cargo planes to ship agricultural products, also on the four-lane SR 86 expressway or the "
NAFTA
 highway" for international traffic. 

The 
Greyhound
 and 
Amtrak
 passenger buses have a highly-used bus depot in downtown Indio, where busses stop by regularly on the way to stops in 
Southern California
, 
Arizona
 and the Mexican border. The city is part of the 
SunBus
 line, which services much of the Coachella Valley.
