Transportation
[

The town was laid out in 
1894
 by A.G. Tingman, a 
Southern Pacific Railroad
 construction boss.  Tingman was also Indio's first storekeeper and postmaster.  Indio was chosen as a railroad stop because it was the halfway point between 
Los Angeles
 and 
Yuma, Arizona
.  Tingman Avenue, once downtown Indio's main street was named in his honor; it was removed during the construction of a highway overpass on Jackson Street designed to eliminate a railroad grade crossing and traffic congestion along Indio Boulevard (old Highway 99, which see).  

Today, the Southern Pacific's successor, the 
Union Pacific Railroad
 maintains that original rail corridor as the main transcontinental line between Los Angeles and 
New Orleans, Louisiana
.  Indio's growth over the years was attributable both to the railroad and the coming of 
U.S. Highway 99
 in 
1926
.  Once California's main north-south highway, US 99 was decommissioned in 
1964
.  Its present-day replacements are 
California State Highway 111
, 
California State Highway 86
 and 
Interstate 10
.  The original 
1903
 railroad station, a two-story wooden structure unique to the Southern Pacific, burned to the ground in 
1966
.  Some of the station's artifacts were salvaged and can be viewed at the Coachella Valley Museum and Cultural Center in downtown Indio.  The aforementioned present-day Indio Boulevard was the site of the world's first use of a painted line to delineate lanes of traffic and was spearheaded by Dr. 
June McCarroll
 for whom a stretch of 
Interstate 10
 through the city is named.

Bermuda Dunes Airport (FAA designator: UDD) has a 5,000 foot runway and is on the north-western border of Indio.

In 2005, Indio's population estimate was at 65,000 residents, while other estimates ranged from 75,000 to 85,000. Indio ranks one of the 10 fastest growing cities in California. If current trends continue, Indio will have over 80,000 by 2010 or pass the 100,000 mark in the next decade. 

When nearby golf resort cities of 
Palm Springs
 are built-up and expensive, Indio, the neighboring towns of 
Coachella
 and 
La Quinta
 became popular destinations for new movers relocating to the area, and year-round residents sought a moderately-priced home. 

Expected to have 5,000 new single family homes and 1,000 apartment units by the year 2012, Indio handles unprecedented growth for being a selection for new residents and are expanding city public services, including new recreation activities, commercial retail centers, and industrial business complexes. 

The majority of residents and newcomers are 
Latino
, and a high proportion of immigrants from Mexico have arrived. The number of foreign born residents is high in ratio to the town's population. The proximity to the border is 80 miles (120 kms. away) and Indio is a magnet for job opportunities for both immigrants and across the state or nation.
