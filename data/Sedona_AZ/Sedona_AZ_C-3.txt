'''Sedona''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|d|oʊ|n|ə}} {{respell|si|DOH|nə}}) is a city that straddles the county line between [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino]] and [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai]] counties in the northern [[Verde Valley]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 10,031.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0465350| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212174311/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0465350| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020|title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Sedona city, Arizona|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder|access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> The city is within the [[Coconino National Forest]].

Sedona's main attraction is its array of pink [[sandstone]] formations. The formations appear to glow in pink when illuminated by the rising or setting sun. The pink rocks form a popular backdrop for many activities, ranging from spiritual pursuits to the hundreds of hiking and mountain biking trails.

Sedona was named after [[Sedona Schnebly]] whose husband, Theodore Carlton Schnebly, was the city's first postmaster. She was celebrated for her hospitality and industriousness.<ref>[http://www.sharlot.org/archives/rosegarden/show.pl?woman=SEDONA%20MILLER%20SCHNEBLY Territorial Women's Memorial Rose Garden: Sedona Arabelle Miller Schnebly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418174926/http://sharlot.org/archives/rosegarden/show.pl?woman=SEDONA%20MILLER%20SCHNEBLY |date=April 18, 2007 }}.

==History==
===Anglo-American settlement===
The first European-American settler, John J. Thompson, moved to [[Oak Creek Canyon]] in 1876,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-03-24 |title=History of Sedona |url=https://sedonamuseum.org/historyofsedona/ |access-date=2024-09-12 |website=Sedona Heritage Museum |language=en-US}}</ref> an area well known for its peach and apple orchards. The early settlers were farmers and ranchers. In 1902, when the Sedona post office was established, there were 55 residents. In the mid-1950s, the first telephone directory listed 155 names. Some parts of the Sedona area were not electrified until the 1960s.

The area, then unincorporated, had no local government and was bisected by two counties. Growth increased after a resident discovered water. That meant area residents no longer had to transport water, and could directly build infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rigby|first=Elizebeth [sic]|title=Water Discovery Leads Sedona to Rapid Boom|newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Sun]]|date=1967-07-17|page=[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/161731901/ 2]|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

Sedona began to develop as a tourist destination, vacation-home and retirement center in the 1950s. Most of the development seen today was constructed in the 1980s and 1990s. As of 2007, there are no large tracts of undeveloped land remaining.<ref>Heidinger & Trevillyan (2007). ''Images of America: Sedona'', Arcadia Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-7385-4800-5}}</ref>

Important early settlers included the Steele family, originally of Scotland.

===Chapel of the Holy Cross===
In 1956, construction of the [[Chapel of the Holy Cross (Sedona, Arizona)|Chapel of the Holy Cross]] was completed. The chapel rises {{convert|70|ft|m}} out of a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} redrock cliff.<ref name="Chapel">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/usa/sedona-chapel-of-the-holy-cross|title=Chapel of the Holy Cross|publisher=Sacred Destinations|date=April 18, 2009|access-date=May 18, 2010}}</ref> The most prominent feature of the chapel is the cross. Later a chapel was added. Inside the chapel there is a window and a cross with benches and pews.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Somerville|first1=Sylvia|title=Chapel of the Holy Cross, Sedona Architectural Landmark|url=http://www.gatewaytosedona.com/the-chapel-of-the-holy-cross-sedona-architectural-landmark|website=Gateway To Sedona|publisher=Range Dog Publishing Inc.|access-date=February 9, 2017|archive-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080427/http://www.gatewaytosedona.com/the-chapel-of-the-holy-cross-sedona-architectural-landmark|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Cinematic legacy===
Sedona played host to more than sixty Hollywood productions from the first years of movies into the 1970s. Stretching as far back as 1923, Sedona's pink rocks were a fixture in major Hollywood productions{{snd}}including films such as ''[[Angel and the Badman]]'', ''[[Desert Fury]]'', ''[[Blood on the Moon]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'', ''[[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]'' and [[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|''Broken Arrow'']]. However, the surroundings typically were identified to audiences as the terrain of Texas, California, Nevada, and even Canada–US border territory.<ref>McNeill, Joe. "{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20100131135803/http://www.arizonaslittlehollywood.com/ Arizona's Little Hollywood]}}: Sedona and Northern Arizona's Forgotten Film History 1923–1973" (2010, Northedge & Sons)</ref> The town lent its name to the 2011 film [[Sedona (film)|''Sedona'']], which is set in the community. Additionally, HIM, a film exploring the “reality” of reality dating television, was shot entirely in Sedona in 2023, and made it’s premiere at the Sedona International Film Festival in 2024.
