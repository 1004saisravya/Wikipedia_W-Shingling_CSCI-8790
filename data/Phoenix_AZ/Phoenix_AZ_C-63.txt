Phoenix is the most populous city of the 
Phoenix metropolitan area
, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is part of the 
Salt River Valley
 and 
Arizona Sun Corridor
. The metro area is the 
10th-largest by population
 in the United States with approximately 4.95 million people as of 2020
[update]
, making it the most populous in the 
Southwestern United States
.
[

 Phoenix, the seat of 
Maricopa County
, is the largest city by population and area in Arizona, with an area of 517.9 square miles (1,341 km
2
), and is also the 
11th-largest city by area
 in the United States.
[

]


Phoenix was settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the 
Salt
 and 
Gila Rivers
 and was incorporated as a city in 1881. It became the capital of 
Arizona Territory
 in 1889.
[
15
]
 Its 
canal system
 led to a thriving farming community with the original settlers' crops, such as 
alfalfa
, 
cotton
, 
citrus
, and 
hay
, remaining important parts of the 
local economy
 for decades.
[
16
]
[
17
]
 Cotton, 
cattle
, citrus, 
climate
, and 
copper
 were known locally as the "Five C's" anchoring Phoenix's economy. These remained the driving forces of the city until after 
World War II
, when 
high-tech
 companies began to move into the valley and 
air conditioning
 made Phoenix's hot summers more bearable.

Phoenix is the cultural center of Arizona.
[
19
]
 It is in the northeastern reaches of the 
Sonoran Desert
 and is known for its 
hot desert climate
.
[

 The region's 
gross domestic product
 reached over $362 billion by 2022.
[

 The city averaged a four percent annual 
population growth
 rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s,
[
23
]
 and was among the nation's ten most populous cities by 1980. Phoenix is also one of 
the largest plurality Hispanic cities
 in the United States, with 42% of its population being 
Hispanic

Early history
[
edit
]


Map of 
Hohokam
 lands 
c.
 1350


The 
Hohokam
 people occupied the Phoenix area for 2,000 years.
[
25
]
[
26
]
 They created roughly 135 miles (217 kilometers) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable, and paths of these canals were used for the 
Arizona Canal
, 
Central Arizona Project
 Canal, and the 
Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct
. They also carried out extensive trade with the nearby 
Ancient Puebloans
, 
Mogollon
, and 
Sinagua
, as well as with the more distant 
Mesoamerican
 civilizations.
[
27
]
 It is believed periods of drought and severe floods between 1300 and 1450 led to the Hohokam civilization's abandonment of the area.
[
28
]


After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of 
Akimel O'odham
 (commonly known as Pima), 
Tohono O'odham
, and 
Maricopa
 tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the 
Yavapai
 and Apache.
[
29
]
 The O'odham were offshoots of the 
Sobaipuri
 tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the Hohokam.
[
30
]
[
31
]
[
32
]


The Akimel O'odham were the major group in the area. They lived in small villages with well-defined irrigation systems that spread over the Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their crops included corn, beans, and squash for food as well as cotton and tobacco. They banded with the Maricopa for protection against incursions by the Yuma and Apache tribes.
[
33
]
 The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people; however, they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with other Yuma tribes, settling among the existing communities of the Akimel O'odham.
[
34
]
[
35
]
[
29
]


The Tohono O'odham also lived in the region, but largely to the south and all the way to the Mexican border.
[
36
]
 The O'odham lived in small settlements as seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. They grew crops such as sweet corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils, sugar cane, and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit, and 
javelina
 for meat.
[
37
]
[
38
]


The 
Mexican–American War
 ended in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States, and the region's residents became U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the 
New Mexico Territory
.
[
39
]
 In 1863, the mining town of 
Wickenburg
 was the first to be established in Maricopa County, to the northwest of Phoenix. Maricopa County had not been incorporated; the land was within 
Yavapai County
, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg.

The Army created 
Fort McDowell
 on the 
Verde River
 in 1865 to forestall Indian uprisings.
[
40
]
 The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. Other nearby settlements later merged to become the city of 
Tempe
.
[
41
]




Founding and incorporation
[
edit
]


The Phillip Darrell Duppa adobe house was built in 1870 and is the oldest house in Phoenix. The homestead is named after "Lord" Darrell Duppa, an Englishman who is credited with naming Phoenix and Tempe as well as founding the town of New River.


The history of Phoenix begins with 
Jack Swilling
, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War who prospected in the nearby mining town of 
Wickenburg
 in the newly formed 
Arizona Territory
. As he traveled through the 
Salt River Valley
 in 1867, he saw a potential for farming to supply Wickenburg with food. He also noted the eroded mounds of dirt that indicated previous canals dug by native peoples who had long since left the area. He formed the Swilling Irrigation and Canal Company that year, dug a large canal that drew in river water, and erected several crop fields in a location that is now within the eastern portion of central Phoenix near its airport. Other settlers soon began to arrive, appreciating the area's fertile soil and lack of frost, and the farmhouse Swilling constructed became a frequently-visited location in the valley.
[
42
]
[
43
]
 
Lord Darrell Duppa
 was one of the original settlers in Swilling's party, and he suggested the name "Phoenix", as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.
[
25
]


The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster.
[
25
]
 In October 1870, valley residents met to select a new townsite for the valley's growing population. A new location three miles to the west of the original settlement, containing several allotments of farmland, was chosen, and lots began to officially be sold under the name of Phoenix in December of that year. This established the downtown core in a grid layout pattern that has been the hallmark of Phoenix's urban development ever since.

On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County; it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory. The first election for county office was held in 1871 when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. He ran unopposed when the other two candidates (John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite) fought a duel; Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race.
[
25
]


The town grew during the 1870s, and President 
Ulysses S. Grant
 issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, 16 saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul. An election was held in 1875, and three village trustees and other officials were elected.
[
25
]
 By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.
[
44
]

By 1881, Phoenix's continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill, incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor-council government; Governor 
John C. Fremont
 signed the bill on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around 2,500.
[
25
]


The railroad's arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets. In response, the 
Phoenix Chamber of Commerce
 was organized on November 4, 1888.
[
45
]
 The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in 1888.
[
25
]
 The territorial capital moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889, and the territorial offices were also in City Hall.
[
46
]
 The arrival of the 
Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway
 in 1895 connected Phoenix to Prescott, Flagstaff, and other communities in the northern part of the territory. The increased access to commerce expedited the city's economic rise. The 
Phoenix Union High School
 was established in 1895 with an enrollment of 90.
[
25
]




1901 to World War II
[
edit
]


Central Avenue, Phoenix, 1908


On February 25, 1901, Governor 
Oakes Murphy
 dedicated the permanent 
Capitol building
,
[
25
]
 and the 
Carnegie Free Library
 opened seven years later, on February 18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler.
[
47
]
 The 
National Reclamation Act
 was signed by President 
Theodore Roosevelt
 in 1902, which allowed dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes.
[
48
]
 The first dam constructed under the act, 
Salt River Dam#1
, began in 1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose dam, and Roosevelt attended the official dedication on May 18, 1911. At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming 
a lake
 in the mountains east of Phoenix.
[
49
]
 The dam would be renamed after Teddy Roosevelt in 1917,
[
50
]
 and the lake would follow suit in 1959.
[
51
]


On February 14, 1912, Phoenix became a state capital, as Arizona was admitted to the Union as the 48th state under President 
William Howard Taft
.
[
52
]
 This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona, due to his disapproval of the state constitution's position on the recall of judges.
[
53
]
 In 1913, Phoenix's move from a mayor-council system to 
council-manager
 made it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix's growth started to accelerate; eight years later, its population reached 29,053. In 1920, Phoenix would see its first skyscraper, the 
Heard Building
; it was the tallest building in the state until the completion of the 
Luhrs Building
 in 1924.
[
25
]
 In 1929, 
Sky Harbor
 was officially opened, at the time owned by 
Scenic Airways
. The city purchased it in 1935 and continues to operate it today.
[
54
]

On March 4, 1930, former U.S. President 
Calvin Coolidge
 dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam was virtually dry. The humorist 
Will Rogers
, who was on hand as a guest speaker joked, "If that was my lake, I'd mow it."
[
55
]
 Phoenix's population had nearly doubled during the 1920s and by 1930 stood at 48,118.
[
25
]
 It was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called "The Valley of the Sun", which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism.
[
56
]


During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an "embryonic industrial city" with the mass production of military supplies.
[
25
]
 There were three air force fields in the area: 
Luke Field
, 
Williams Field
, and 
Falcon Field
, as well as two large pilot training camps, 
Thunderbird Field No. 1
 in Glendale and 
Thunderbird Field No. 2
 in Scottsdale.
[
25
]
[
57
]
[
58
]




Post-World War II explosive growth
[
edit
]


A town that had just over 65,000 residents in 1940 became America's fifth most populous city by 2020, with a population of nearly 1.6 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. After the war, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned with their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area.
[
25
]
 In 1948, high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when 
Motorola
 chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies, such as 
Intel
 and 
McDonnell Douglas
, moved into the valley and opened manufacturing operations.
[
59
]
[
60
]


By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities.
[
25
]
 The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946.
[
61
]


Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a 
US Commission on Civil Rights
 of hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American.
[
62
]
 Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of 
Van Buren Street
 would rent to the African-American baseball star 
Willie Mays
, in town for spring training in the 1960s.
[
63
]
 In 1964, a reporter from 
The New Republic
 wrote of segregation in these terms: "Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course."
[
64
]




1960s to present
[
edit
]

The continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley to take advantage of the labor pool,
[
65
]
 and manufacturing, particularly in the electronics sector, continued to grow.
[
66
]
 The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade.
[
67
]
 In 1965, the 
Phoenix Corporate Center
 opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet.
[
68
]
 The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today called 
Phoenix City Square
,
[
69
]
 the landmark 
Phoenix Financial Center
 (1964),
[
70
]
 as well as many of Phoenix's residential high-rises. In 1965 the 
Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum
 opened at the 
Arizona State Fairgrounds
, west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded an 
NBA
 franchise in 1968, which would be called the 
Phoenix Suns
,
[
71
]
[
72
]
 they played their home games at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to 
America West Arena
.
[
73
]
 In 1968, President 
Lyndon B. Johnson
 approved the 
Central Arizona Project
, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor between them.
[
74
]
[
75
]
 The following year, 
Pope Paul VI
 created the 
Diocese of Phoenix
 on December 2, by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson, with 
Edward A. McCarthy
 as the first Bishop.
[
76
]


In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. The nine original villages
[
77
]
 have expanded to 15 over the years (see 
Cityscape
 below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The 
Phoenix Symphony Hall
 opened in 1972;
[
78
]
 other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the 
First National Bank Plaza
, the 
Valley Center
 (the tallest building in Arizona),
[
79
]
 and the 
Arizona Bank building
.

On September 25, 1981, Phoenix resident 
Sandra Day O'Connor
 broke the gender barrier on the 
U.S. Supreme Court
, when she was sworn in as the first female justice.
[
80
]
 In 1985, the 
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station
, the nation's largest nuclear power plant, began electrical production.
[
81
]
 
Pope John Paul II
 and 
Mother Teresa
 both visited the Valley in 1987.
[
82
]


There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the 
Sunnyslope
 area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by 2000.
[
83
]
 The new 20-story 
City Hall
 opened in 1992.
[
84
]


Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by 
Las Vegas
.
[
85
]
 In 2008, Squaw Peak, the city's second tallest mountain, was renamed 
Piestewa Peak
 after Army Specialist 
Lori Ann Piestewa
, an Arizonan and the first 
Native American
 woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female casualty of the 
2003 Iraq War
.
[
86
]
 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the 
subprime mortgage crisis
, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007.
[
87
]
 Crime rates in Phoenix have fallen in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as 
South Mountain
, 
Alhambra
, and 
Maryvale
 have recovered and stabilized. On June 1, 2023, the State of Arizona announced the decision to halt new housing development in the Phoenix metropolitan area that relies solely on 
groundwater
 due to a predicted water shortfall.

Geography
[
edit
]


Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Phoenix metro area in 2020


Phoenix is in the south-central portion of Arizona; about halfway between 
Tucson
 to the southeast and 
Flagstaff
 to the north, in the 
Southwestern United States
. By car, the city is approximately 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the US–Mexico border at 
Sonoyta
 and 180 mi (290 km) north of the border at 
Nogales
. The metropolitan area is known as the "Valley of the Sun" due to its location in the Salt River Valley.
[
56
]
 It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331 m), in the northern reaches of the 
Sonoran Desert
.
[
89
]


Other than the mountains in and around the city, Phoenix's topography is generally flat, which allows the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: 
McDowell Mountains
 to the northeast, the 
White Tank Mountains
 to the west, the 
Superstition Mountains
 far to the east, and both 
South Mountain
 and the 
Sierra Estrella
 to the south/southwest. 
Camelback Mountain
, North Mountain, 
Sunnyslope Mountain
, and 
Piestewa Peak
 are within the heart of the valley. The city's outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands.
[
90
]
 The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions. South Mountain separates the community of 
Ahwatukee
 from the rest of the city.

Ahwatukee
 neighborhoods and the 
South Mountains


According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 517.9 sq mi (1,341 km
2
), of which 516.7 sq mi (1,338 km
2
) is land and 1.2 sq mi (3.1 km
2
), or 0.2%, is water.

Maricopa County
 grew by 711% from 186,000 in 1940 to 1,509,000 by 1980, due in part to air conditioning, cheap housing, and an influx of retirees. The once "modest urban sprawl" now "grew by 'epic' proportions—not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert." Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area. There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development.
[
91
]
 As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of 
urban sprawl
 for geographers.
[
92
]
[
93
]
[
94
]
[
95
]
[
96
]
[
97
]
 Even though it is the fifth most populated city in the United States, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 2,797 people per square mile.
[
98
]
 In comparison, 
Philadelphia
, the sixth most populous city with nearly the same population as Phoenix, has a density of over 11,000 people per square mile.
[
99
]


Like most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe 
daylight saving time
. In 1973, Governor 
Jack Williams
 argued to the U.S. Congress that energy use would increase in the evening should Arizona observe DST. He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day "because there would be more lights on in the early morning." Additionally, he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark.

Map of the urban villages of Phoenix


Since 1979, the city of Phoenix has been divided into 
urban villages
, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix.
[
101
]
 Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council. According to the city-issued village planning handbook, the purpose of the village planning committees is to "work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages."
[
102
]
 There are 15 urban villages: 
Ahwatukee Foothills
, 
Alhambra
, 
Camelback East
, 
Central City
, 
Deer Valley
, Desert View, 
Encanto
, 
Estrella
, 
Laveen
, 
Maryvale
, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, 
Rio Vista
, and South Mountain.

The urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby 
Town of Paradise Valley
. Although the urban village is part of Phoenix, the town is independent.

In addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as 
Downtown
, 
Midtown
, Uptown,
[

 West Phoenix, 
North Phoenix
, 
South Phoenix
, 
Biltmore Area
, 
Arcadia
, and 
Sunnyslope
.



Flora and fauna
[
edit
]


While some of the native flora and fauna of the 
Sonoran Desert
 can be found within Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city. Native mammal species include 
coyote
, 
javelina
, 
bobcat
, 
mountain lion
, 
desert cottontail rabbit
, 
jackrabbit
, 
antelope ground squirrel
, 
mule deer
, 
ringtail
, 
coati
, and multiple species of bats, such as the 
Mexican free-tailed bat
 and 
western pipistrelle
, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including 
Costa's hummingbird
, 
Anna's hummingbird
, 
Gambel's quail
, 
Gila woodpecker
, 
mourning dove
, 
white-winged dove
, the 
greater roadrunner
, the 
cactus wren
, and many species of raptors, including 
falcons
, 
hawks
, 
owls
, 
vultures
 (such as the 
turkey vulture
 and 
black vulture
), and 
eagles
, including the 
golden
 and the 
bald eagle
.

The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of 
rosy-faced lovebirds
 in the U.S. This bird is a popular 
birdcage
 pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These 
lovebirds
 prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead 
palm tree
 fronds.
[
106
]
[
107
]


The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the 
Western diamondback rattlesnake
, 
Sonoran sidewinder
, several other types of rattlesnakes, 
Sonoran coral snake
, dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the 
Sonoran gopher snake
 and the 
California kingsnake
), the 
gila monster
, 
desert spiny lizard
, several types of 
whiptail lizards
, the 
chuckwalla
, 
desert horned lizard
, 
western banded gecko
, 
Sonora mud turtle
, and the 
desert tortoise
. Native amphibian species include the 
Couch's spadefoot toad
, 
Chiricahua leopard frog
, and the 
Sonoran desert toad
.
[

Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the 
Arizona bark scorpion
, 
giant desert hairy scorpion
, 
Arizona blond tarantula
, 
Sonoran Desert centipede
, 
tarantula hawk wasp
, 
camel spider
, and 
tailless whip scorpion
. Of great concern is the presence of 
Africanized bees
 which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.

The Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has "the most structurally diverse flora in the United States." One of the most well-known types of succulents, the 
giant saguaro cactus
, is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs. Other native species are the 
organpipe
, 
barrel
, 
fishhook
, 
senita
, 
prickly pear
 and 
cholla
 cacti; 
ocotillo
; 
Palo Verde trees

Climate of Phoenix


The 
Sonoran Desert
 surrounding Phoenix


Phoenix has a 
hot desert climate
 (
Köppen:
 
BWh
),
[
20
]
[
21
]
 typical of the 
Sonoran Desert
, and is the largest city in the 
Americas
 in this climatic zone.
[
111
]
 Phoenix has long, extremely hot summers and short, mild winters. The city is within one of the world's sunniest regions, with its 
sunshine duration
 comparable to the 
Sahara
 region. With 3,872 hours of bright sunshine annually, Phoenix receives the most sunshine of any major city on Earth.
[
112
]
 Average high temperatures in summer are the hottest of any major city in the United States.
[
113
]
 On average, there are 111 days annually with a high of at least 100 °F (38 °C), including most days from the end of May through late September. Highs top 110 °F (43 °C) an average of 21 days during the year.
[
114
]
 On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of 122 °F (50 °C).
[
115
]
 The annual minimum temperature in Phoenix is in the mid-to-low 30s.
[
114
]
 It rarely drops to 32 °F (0 °C) or below. Snow is rare.
[

]
 In July 2023, it became the first major city in the US to have an average monthly temperature of over 100 °F (38 °C) with an average daily mean temperature for the month at 102.7 °F (39 °C), which is also the hottest month ever recorded in the city.
[
116
]
 That same month the city had an unprecedented streak of 31 days with 110 °F (43 °C)+ highs that lasted from June 30 to July 30.
[
117
]
 That year the city also had a record 55 days of daily highs topping 110 °F (43 °C)+, which also made summer of 2023 the hottest on record there,
[
118
]
 until it was beaten by the summer of 2024 with the hottest ever June at 97.0 °F (36 °C),
[
119
]
 the third hottest August
[
120
]
 at 98.7 °F (37 °C) and the 2nd hottest July record at 101.1 °F (38 °C) by average daily temperature respectively.
[
121
]
 That same year in 2024, it also recorded an unprecedented 113 day streak of daily highs topping 100 °F (38 °C)+ that lasted from May 27 to September 16 and ultimately recorded a record 70 110 °F (43 °C) days in a single year, ending by October 7.
[
122
]
[
123
]
  Because extreme heat is so common, nearly all homes in Phoenix have 
air conditioning
, though poorer residents may not be able to afford to repair or operate them when needed.
[

Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, was ranked seventh for most 
ozone pollution
 in the United States according to the 
American Lung Association
.
[
125
]
 Vehicle emissions are cited as precursors to ozone formation. Phoenix also has high levels of 
particulate
 pollution; although, cities in California lead the nation in this hazard.
[
126
]
 PM2.5 particulate matter, which is a component of diesel engine exhaust, and larger PM10 particles, which can come from dust, can both reach concerning levels in Phoenix.
[
127
]
 In fact, people, pets, and other animals exposed to high concentrations of PM10 dust particles―primarily from dust storms or from disturbed agricultural or construction sites―are at risk of contracting 
Valley Fever
, a fungal lung infection.
[
128
]


Unlike most desert locations which have drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the 
urban heat island
 effect limits Phoenix's 
diurnal temperature variation
.
[
129
]
 As the city has expanded, average summer low temperatures have been steadily rising. Pavement, sidewalks, and buildings store the Sun's heat and radiate it at night.
[
130
]
 The daily normal low remains at or above 80 °F (27 °C) for an average of 74 days per summer.
[
114
]
 On July 19, 2023, at the height of an unprecedent heatwave that caused daily highs to top 110 °F (43 °C) or higher that lasted for 31 days straight, Phoenix set its record for the warmest daily low temperature, at 97 °F (36 °C).
[

A 2011 
haboob


The city averages approximately 300 days of sunshine, or over 85% of daylight hours, per year,
[
131
]
[
132
]
 and receives scant rainfall―the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is 7.22 in (183 mm). The region's trademark dry and sunny weather is interrupted by sporadic Pacific storms in the winter and the arrival of the 
North American monsoon
 in the summer.
[
133
]
 Historically, the monsoon officially started when the average 
dew point
 was 55 °F (13 °C) for three days in a row—typically occurring in early July. To increase monsoon awareness and promote safety, however, the National Weather Service decreed that starting in 2008, June 15 would be the official "first day" of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30.
[
134
]
 When active, the monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, and 
dust storms
[
135
]
—which can rise to the level of a 
haboob
 in some years.

As of 2020, Phoenix was the fifth most 
populous city in the United States
, with the census bureau placing its population at 1,608,139, edging out 
Philadelphia
 with a population of 1,567,872.
[
147
]
 In the aftermath of the Great Recession, Phoenix had a population of 1,445,632 according to the 
2010 United States census
, the sixth largest city and still the most populous state capital in the United States.
[
148
]
 Prior to the Great Recession, in 2006, Phoenix's population was 1,512,986, the fifth largest just ahead of Philadelphia.
[
148
]


After leading the U.S. in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly from its peak in 2006 of 162,000.
[
149
]
[
150
]
 Despite this slowing, Phoenix's population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the same time frame of 9.7%.
[
151
]
[
152
]
 Not since 1940–50, when the city had a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade. Phoenix's recent growth rate of 9.4% from the 2010 census is the first time it has recorded a growth rate under 24% in a census decade.
[
153
]
 However, in 2016, Phoenix once again became the fastest growing city in the United States, adding approximately 88 people per day during the preceding year.
[

The Phoenix 
Metropolitan Statistical Area
 (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler MSA
[
154
]
), is one of 10 MSAs in Arizona, and was the 11th largest in the United States, with a 2018 U.S. census population estimate of 4,857,962, up from the 2010 census population of 4,192,887. Consisting of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% of Arizona's population.
[
151
]
[
152
]
 Phoenix only contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly from its 33% share during the prior decade.
[
153
]
 Phoenix is also part of the 
Arizona Sun Corridor
 
megaregion
 (MR), which is the tenth most populous of the 11 MRs, and the eighth largest by area. It had the second largest growth by percentage of the MRs (behind only the Gulf Coast MR) between 2000 and 2010.
[
155
]


The population is almost equally split between men and women, with men making up 50.2% of city's citizens. The population density is 2,797.8 people per square mile, and the city's median age is 32.2 years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix's population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people.

There were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of non-family households, 27.1% have a householder living alone, almost evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 13.5%.

As of 2020
[update]
, Phoenix has 590,149 dwelling units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%. The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals. Vacant houses for sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among vacation properties and other various reasons.
[
156

The city's median household income was $47,866, and the median family income was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. The city's per capita income was $24,110. 21.8% of the population and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

 In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% in 2010. However, a large part of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the 
U.S. Census Bureau
 in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as "other races".

Economy

Main article: 
Economy of Phoenix


Downtown Phoenix


Phoenix's early economy focused on agriculture and natural resources, especially the "5Cs" of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and citrus.
[
18
]
 With the opening of the Union Station in 1923, the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport in 1928, the city became more easily accessible.
[
171
]
 The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway.
[
172
]
[
173
]
 At the conclusion of 
World War II
, the valley's economy surged, as many men who had completed their military training at bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of 
Sun City
. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America,
[
174
]
 and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960.
[
175
]
[
176
]
 The city averaged a four percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.
[
23
]


As the 
national financial crisis of 2007–10
 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed and housing prices plunged.
[
177
]
 Arizona jobs declined by 11.8% from peak to trough; in 2007 Phoenix had 1,918,100 employed individuals, by 2010 that number had shrunk by 226,500 to 1,691,600.
[
178
]
 By the end of 2015, the employment number in Phoenix had risen to 1.97 million, finally regaining its pre-
recession
 levels,
[
179
]
 with job growth occurring across the board.
[
180
]


As of 2017
[update]
, the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just under $243 billion. The top five industries were: 
real estate
 ($41.96), 
finance and insurance
 ($19.71), 
manufacturing
 ($19.91), 
retail trade
 ($18.64), and 
health care
 ($19.78). Government (including federal, state and local), if it had been a private industry, would have been ranked second on the list, generating $23.37 billion.
[
181
]


In Phoenix, real estate developers face few constraints when planning and developing new projects.
[
182
]


As of January 2016, 10.5% of the workforce were government employees, a high number because the city is both the county seat and state capital. The civilian labor force was 2,200,900, and the unemployment rate stood at 4.6%.

Crime in Phoenix


By the 1960s, crime was a major problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s, crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the country.
[
291
]
 It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, 
Ernesto Miranda
 was arrested and charged with rape. The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, 
Miranda v. Arizona
, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a 
Miranda Warning
 to all suspected criminals.
[
292
]


With Phoenix's rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as 
the Tainted Desert
.
[
293
]
 These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when 
Arizona Republic
 writer 
Don Bolles
 was murdered by a car bomb in 1976.
[
294
]
[
295
]
 It was believed his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.
[
296
]
[
297
]
[
298
]

Bolles was the only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due to his coverage of a story.
[
296
]
 Max Dunlap was convicted of first-degree murder in the case.
[
298
]


Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow.
[
299
]

After seeing a peak in the early and mid-1990s, the city has seen a general decrease in crime rates. The Maricopa County Jail system is the fourth-largest in the country.
[
300
]
 The violent crime rate peaked in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.
[
301
]


In 2001 and 2002, Phoenix ranked first in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen each year respectively.
[
302
]
 It has declined every year since then, eventually falling to 7,200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe.
[
303
]
 The Phoenix MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.
[
304

On August 2, 2022, 
a mass shooting
 took place in the 
Deer Valley
 area of Phoenix. The shooter killed two bystanders and injured five others before committing 
suicide

Roads and freeways

Main article: 
Roads and freeways in metropolitan Phoenix


Phoenix auto traffic depends on both freeways and surface streets. Freeways fall under the auspices of the 
Arizona Department of Transportation
 (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges.
[
343
]
 While being the fifth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix's freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.
[
344
]




The Stack (Interstates 10 and 17) interchange at night in 2012
Part of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city, due to most of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985.
[
345
]
 Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have at least two Interstate Highways, but no three-digit interstates.
[
346
]


As of 2005
[update]
, the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation's largest and fastest growing freeway systems, consisting of over 1,405 lane miles (2,261 lane km).
[
347
]
 The freeway system is a mix of Interstate, U.S., and state highways which include 
Interstate 10
, 
Interstate 17
, 
US 60
, 
Loop 101
, 
Loop 202
, 
SR 51
, 
SR 143
, and 
Loop 303
. There are still major additions to routes 101, 202 and 303 underway, as well as several other smaller projects around the valley.
[
348
]
 State Routes 
87
, 
85
, and 
74
 connect Phoenix with other areas of the Valley and Arizona.
[
349
]


The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north–south or east–west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street.
[
349
]
 The one notable exception to this is the diagonal 
Grand Avenue
, which runs northwest–southeast. The original plan was for the east–west streets to be named after U.S. Presidents, with the north–south streets named after Native Americans; but the north–south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with numbered Avenues running to the west of Central, and numbered Streets to its east.
[
25
]
 Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6 km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every 
1
⁄
8
 mile (200 m). For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block east, lies nine miles (14 km) to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).

Central Arizona Project (CAP) canal


Being in the desert, Phoenix relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which divert water from the region's rivers and lakes, with the largest portion of the city's water coming from the 
Colorado River
 through the 
Central Arizona Project
's canal.
[
351
]
 The city's electrical needs are served primarily by Arizona Public Service, although some customers receive their electricity from the 
Salt River Project
 (SRP). The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear and coal power plants. Arizona is home to the 
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station
, the largest nuclear-generating facility in the United States. SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.

In 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.
