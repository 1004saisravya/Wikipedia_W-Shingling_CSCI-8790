Nicknamed "The 'Bu" by surfers and locals,<ref name="Poole" /><ref name="Taylor" /><ref name="Partridge" /> Malibu is noted for its beaches. The many parks within the [[Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area]] lie along the ridges above the city.

The city is bounded by the Santa Monica Mountains to the north, [[Topanga, California|Topanga]] to the east, [[Solromar, California|Solromar]] to the west, and the ocean to the south. The Malibu ZIP Code includes residents of the unincorporated canyon areas as it was assigned before the city incorporated.

==History==

[[File:Granville Redmond Malibu Coast Spring.jpg|thumb|"Malibu Coast, Spring" by [[Granville Redmond]], {{Circa|1929}}]]

The area is within the [[Ventureño language|Ventureño]] [[Chumash people|Chumash]] territory, which extended from the [[San Joaquin Valley]] to [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] to Malibu, as well as several islands off the southern coast of California. The Chumash called the settlement ''[[Humaliwo]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24435 |title=Humaliwo: An Ethnographic Overview of the Chumash in Malibu |publisher=Parks.ca.gov |access-date=November 2, 2007 |archive-date=October 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022174723/http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24435 |url-status=live }}</ref> or "the surf sounds loudly". The city's name derives from this, as the "Hu" syllable is not stressed.

Humaliwo was an important regional center in prehistoric times. The village, which is identified as CA-LAN-264, was occupied from approximately 2500 BCE. It was the second-largest Chumash coastal settlement by the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], after Muwu ([[Point Mugu]]). This pre-colonial village was next to [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach|Malibu Lagoon]] and is now part of the State Park.<ref>McCall, Lynne & Rosalind, Perry, red.

Humaliwo was considered an important political center, but there were additional minor settlements in the area. One village, Ta'lopop, was a few miles up [[Malibu Canyon]] from Malibu Lagoon. Research shows that Humaliwo had ties to other pre-colonial villages, including Hipuk (in [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]]), Lalimanux (by [[Conejo Grade]]) and Huwam (in [[Bell Canyon, California|Bell Canyon]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=24435|title=Humaliwo: An Ethnographic Overview of the Chumash in Malibu|website=CA State Parks|access-date=November 9, 2017|archive-date=November 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061833/https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=24435|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Gamble, Lynn H.

Conquistador [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] is believed to have moored at Malibu Lagoon, at the mouth of Malibu Creek, to obtain fresh water in 1542. The Spanish presence returned with the [[Spanish missions in California|California mission]] system, and the area was part of [[Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit]]—a {{convert|13000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[land grant]]—in 1802. Baptismal records list 118 individuals from Humaliwo. That ranch passed intact to [[Frederick Hastings Rindge]] in 1891. He and his wife, [[Rhoda May Knight Rindge]], staunchly protected their land. After his death, May guarded their property zealously by hiring guards to evict all trespassers and fighting a lengthy court battle to prevent the building of a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific railroad]] line through the ranch. Interstate Commerce Commission regulations would not support a railroad condemning property in order to build tracks that paralleled an existing line, so Frederick Rindge built his own railroad through his property first. He died, and May followed through with the plans, building the [[Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway]]. The line started at Carbon Canyon, just inside the ranch's property eastern boundary, and ran 15 miles westward, past Pt. Dume.<ref>Doyle, Thomas W. et al.

Few roads even entered the area before 1929, when the state won another court case and built what is now known as the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]]. By then May Rindge was forced to divide her property and begin selling and leasing lots. The Rindge house, known as the [[Adamson House]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=672 |title=Adamson House |publisher=Parks.ca.gov |access-date=November 2, 2007 |archive-date=December 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227182626/http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=672 |url-status=live }}</ref> (a [[National Register of Historic Places]] site and [[California Historical Landmark]]), is now part of Malibu Creek State Park, between [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=835 |title=Malibu Lagoon State Beach |publisher=Parks.ca.gov |date=January 19, 2005 |access-date=November 2, 2007 |archive-date=October 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151421/http://parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=835 |url-status=live }}</ref> and Surfrider Beach, beside the Malibu Pier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24409 |title=Malibu Pier |publisher=Parks.ca.gov |access-date=November 2, 2007 |archive-date=March 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314071649/http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24409 |url-status=live }}</ref> that was used to provide transportation to/from the ranch, including construction materials for the Rindge railroad, and to tie up the family's yacht.<ref name="Myrick, David F. pp. 1-53"/><ref>Doyle, Thomas W. and Rindge, Ronald L. ''Malibu Rails and Roads,'' pp. 74, Malibu Lagoon Museum, Malibu, CA, 2012.</ref>

In 1926, in an effort to avoid selling land to stave off insolvency, May Rindge created a small ceramic tile factory. At its height, [[Malibu Potteries]] employed over 100 workers, and produced decorative tiles that furnish many Los Angeles-area public buildings and [[Beverly Hills]] residences. The factory, half a mile east of the pier, was ravaged by a fire in 1931.<ref>Doyle, Thomas W and Rindge, Ronald L. ''Malibu Rails and Roads: A Photographic Journey Across Rancho Topanga-Malibu-Sequit,'' pp. 78–9, Malibu Adamson House Foundation, Malibu, CA, 2012.</ref> It partially reopened in 1932, but could not recover from the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and a steep downturn in Southern California construction projects. A distinct hybrid of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and crafts]] designs, Malibu tile is considered highly collectible. Fine examples of the tiles may be seen at the Adamson House and Serra Retreat, a 50-room mansion that was started in the 1920s as the main Rindge home on a hill overlooking the lagoon. The unfinished building was sold to the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] Order in 1942<ref>[http://www.serraretreat.com/about/index.htm Rindge House sold to Franciscans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701172942/http://www.serraretreat.com/about/index.htm |date=July 1, 2014 }} from serraretreat.com</ref> and is operated as a [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] facility,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.serraretreat.com/ |title=Serra Retreat |publisher=Serra Retreat |access-date=November 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202203447/http://www.serraretreat.com/ |archive-date=February 2, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Serra Retreat. It burned in the 1970 fire and was rebuilt using many of the original tiles.

Most of the Big Rock Drive area was bought in 1936 by [[William Randolph Hearst]], who considered building an estate on the property. In 1944, he sold the lower half of his holdings there to Art Jones, one of Malibu's prominent early realtors, starting with the initial leases of Rindge land in Malibu Colony. He also owned or partly owned the Malibu Inn, Malibu Trading Post, and the Big Rock Beach Cafe (now Moonshadows restaurant). Philiip McAnany owned {{convert|80|acres}} in the upper Big Rock area, which he purchased in 1919, and had two cabins there, one of which burned in a brush fire that swept through the area in 1959, and the other in the 1993 Malibu fire. McAnany Way is named after him.<ref>Map Books of the Los Angeles County Assessor</ref><ref>Lummis, Jr., Dayton.

"Colorful Pioneer of Malibu Inured," ''Evening Outlook,'' December 15, 1970, Santa Monica, CA.</ref> On January 7, 2025, the city was struck by a massive {{convert|17000|acres}} wildfire. With a lack of water, equipment and workers, the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] was forced to start evacuating more than 30,000 citizens from the metropolitan area. Many homes were destroyed in Malibu, including most of the beach homes in the central part of the city. A few homes of well-known celebrities, including [[Paris Hilton]]'s, were also affected by the fire.

=== Malibu Colony ===
Malibu Colony was one of the first areas with private homes after May Rindge opened Malibu to development in 1926. Frederick Rindge paid $10 an acre in 1890.<ref>cite web May K. Rindge, a Fighter to the End https://patch.com/california/malibu/may-k-rindge-a-fighter-to-the-end {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230612220317/https://patch.com/california/malibu/may-k-rindge-a-fighter-to-the-end |date=June 12, 2023 }}</ref> One of Malibu's most famous districts,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://malibuca.org/ |title=MalibuCa.org |publisher=MalibuCa.org |access-date=February 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117081148/http://malibuca.org/ |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> it is south of Malibu Road and the Pacific Coast Highway, west of Malibu Lagoon State Beach, east of Malibu Bluffs Park (formerly a state park), and across from the Malibu Civic Center. May Rindge allowed Hollywood movie stars to build vacation homes in the Colony as a defensive public relations wedge against the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] from taking her property under eminent domain for a coastal train route. The action forced the Southern Pacific to route its [[Coast Line (Union Pacific Railroad)|northbound line inland]] then return to the coast in Ventura. But her long legal battle to protect the Malibu coast was costly, and she died penniless.<ref name="LAT 20160313">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0313-randall-malibu-20160314-story.html |title=The long and complicated fight to preserve paradise in Malibu |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=David K. |last=Randall |date=March 13, 2016 |access-date=July 8, 2016 |archive-date=June 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611215955/http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0313-randall-malibu-20160314-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Long a popular private enclave for wealthy celebrities,<ref>[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Live/Malibu.shtml Celebrities living in Malibu Colony] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329041425/http://www.seeing-stars.com/Live/Malibu.shtml |date=March 29, 2006 }} from seeing-stars.com</ref> the Malibu Colony is a [[gated community]] with multi-million-dollar homes on small lots.

=== Incorporation ===
In 1991, most of the Malibu land grant was incorporated as a city to allow local control of the area (as cities under California law, they are not subject to the same level of county government oversight). Prior to achieving municipal status, the local residents had fought several county-proposed developments, including an offshore freeway,<ref>{{cite news|title=The freeway that never was|work=Malibu Times|date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.malibutimes.com/malibu_life/image_7a26bbac-fa13-11e2-bd99-0019bb2963f4.html|access-date=April 26, 2012|archive-date=August 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806055601/http://www.malibutimes.com/malibu_life/image_7a26bbac-fa13-11e2-bd99-0019bb2963f4.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> a [[nuclear power plant]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Still Generating Controversy|newspaper=LA Times|first=Bob|last=Pool|date=June 14, 2005|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-14-me-malibunuke14-story.html|access-date=April 26, 2015|archive-date=November 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127063256/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-14-me-malibunuke14-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and several plans to replace septic tanks with [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] lines to protect the ocean from seepage that pollutes the marine environment. The incorporation drive gained impetus in 1986, when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved plans for a regional sewer that would have been large enough to serve 400,000 people in the western Santa Monica Mountains. Residents were incensed that they would be assessed taxes and fees to pay for the sewer project, and feared that the Pacific Coast Highway would need to be widened into a freeway to accommodate growth that they did not want. The supervisors fought the incorporation drive and prevented the residents from voting, a decision that was overturned in the courts.

The city councils in the 1990s were unable to write a Local Coastal Plan (LCP) that preserved enough public access to satisfy the [[California Coastal Commission]], as required by the California Coastal Act. The state Legislature eventually passed a Malibu-specific law that allowed the Coastal Commission to write an LCP for Malibu, thus limiting the city's ability to control many aspects of land use. Because of the failure to adequately address [[sewage disposal]] problems in the heart of the city, the local water board ordered Malibu in November 2009 to build a [[sewage plant]] for the Civic Center area. The city council has objected to that solution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_4e823718-43af-11e6-a39e-c36a34ab0860.html |title=Construction Begins on Civic Center Sewer |newspaper=[[Malibu Times]] |first=Arthur |last=Augustyn |date=July 7, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709225633/http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_4e823718-43af-11e6-a39e-c36a34ab0860.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> On February 2, 2007, Civic Center Stormwater Treatment Facility opened.<ref>{{cite web |title=Civic Center Stormwater Treatment Facility |url=https://www.malibucity.org/429/Civic-Center-Stormwater-Treatment-Facili |website=Malibu, CA |access-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921205839/https://www.malibucity.org/429/Civic-Center-Stormwater-Treatment-Facili |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Malibu's Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility Advances with Approvals of Construction Contracts & Land Purchase Agreement |url=https://westsidetoday.com/2016/05/25/malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-advances-approvals-construction-contracts-land-purchase-agreement/ |access-date=September 21, 2022 |work=WestsideToday |date=May 25, 2016 |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921205839/https://westsidetoday.com/2016/05/25/malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-advances-approvals-construction-contracts-land-purchase-agreement/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On June 29, 2016, City of Malibu ''Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility'', Phase 1, broke ground.<ref name="youtube=yxJ1h2X8txM">{{cite web |author1=City of Malibu |title=Civic Center Water Treatment Facility Groundbreaking Ceremony |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxJ1h2X8txM |website=youtube |date=June 29, 2016 |access-date=September 21, 2022 |language=en |quote=MalibuCity.org/CCWTF |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921205838/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxJ1h2X8txM&gl=US&hl=en |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Malibu, City of- Civic Center Wastewater & Recycling Facility Phase I |url=https://bondaccountability.resources.ca.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectPK=16356&PropositionPK=48 |website=bondaccountability.resources.ca.gov |access-date=September 21, 2022 |quote=Actual Completion: 8/1/2019 |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921205839/https://bondaccountability.resources.ca.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectPK=16356&PropositionPK=48 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Groundbreaking Ceremony for Malibu's Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility Set for June 29 |url=https://centurycity-westwoodnews.com/groundbreaking-ceremony-for-malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-set-for-june-29/ |website=Century City News |date=June 22, 2016 |access-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921205839/https://centurycity-westwoodnews.com/groundbreaking-ceremony-for-malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-set-for-june-29/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Civic Center Water Treatment Facility |url=https://www.malibucity.org/837/Civic-Center-Water-Treatment-Facility |website=malibucity.org |access-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-date=September 8, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240908082731/https://www.malibucity.org/837/Civic-Center-Water-Treatment-Facility |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Malibu's Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility Advances with Approvals of Construction Contracts & Land Purchase Agreement |url=https://westsidetoday.com/2016/05/25/malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-advances-approvals-construction-contracts-land-purchase-agreement/ |website=WestsideToday |access-date=September 21, 2022 |date=May 25, 2016 |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921205839/https://westsidetoday.com/2016/05/25/malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-advances-approvals-construction-contracts-land-purchase-agreement/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Mudslides===
One of the most problematic side effects of the fires that periodically rage through Malibu is the destruction of vegetation, which normally provides some degree of topographical stability to the loosely packed shale and sandstone hills during periods of heavy precipitation. [[Rainstorm|Rainstorms]] following large wildfires can thus cause mudslides, in which water-saturated earth and rock moves quickly down mountainsides, or entire slices of mountainside abruptly detach and fall downward.

After the 1993 wildfire stripped the surrounding mountains of their earth-hugging [[chaparral]], torrential rainstorms in early 1994 caused a massive mudslide near Las Flores Canyon that closed down the Pacific Coast Highway for months. Thousands of tons of mud, rocks, and water rained down on the highway.

Mudslides can occur at any time in Malibu, whether a recent fire or rainstorm has occurred or not. Pacific Coast Highway, [[Kanan Dume Road]], and [[Malibu Canyon Road]], as well as many other local roads, have been prone to many subsequent mudslide-related closures. During any period of prolonged or intense rain, Caltrans snowplows patrol most canyon roads in the area, clearing mud, rocks, and other debris from the roads. Such efforts keep most roads passable, but it is typical for one or more of the major roads leading into and out of Malibu to be temporarily closed during the rainy season.

===Storms===
Malibu is periodically subject to intense coastal storms. Occasionally, these unearth remnants of the [[Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway|Rindge railroad]] that was built through Malibu in the early 20th century.

On January 25, 2008, during an unusually large storm for Southern California, a tornado came ashore and struck a naval base's hangar, ripping off the roof. It was the first [[tornado]] to strike Malibu's shoreline in recorded history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Small Tornado Strikes Point Mugu|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2008/jan/25/small-tornado-strikes-point-mugu/|access-date=September 28, 2012|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=January 25, 2008|archive-date=July 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729082431/http://www.vcstar.com/news/2008/jan/25/small-tornado-strikes-point-mugu/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Earthquakes===
Malibu is within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of the [[San Andreas Fault]], a fault over {{convert|800|mi|km}} long that can produce an earthquake over magnitude 8. Several faults are in the region, making the area prone to earthquakes.

The 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]] and the [[1971 Sylmar earthquake]] (magnitudes 6.7 and 6.6, respectively) shook the area. Smaller earthquakes happen more often.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above {{convert|71.6|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Malibu has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=941640&cityname=Malibu,+California,+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Malibu, California Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=July 3, 2018|archive-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921173043/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=941640&cityname=Malibu%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|url-status=live}}</ref> The city's climate is influenced by the Pacific Ocean, resulting in far more moderate temperatures than locations further inland experience. Snow in Malibu is extremely rare, but flurries with higher accumulations in the nearby mountains occurred on January 17, 2007. More recently, snow fell in the city on January 25, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.9news.com/article/weather/accuweather/malibu-snow-snowfall-photos-weather-forecast/507-c4f6e6a1-ce70-4153-859c-273beb266ad7|title=Snow in Malibu?

==Government==

===Municipal government===
Malibu is a general law city governed with a five-member City Council including the mayor and mayor pro tem. The City Council hires a city manager to carry out policies and serve as executive officer. Every even-numbered year either two or three members are elected by the people to serve a four-year term. Usually, the City Council meets in April and chooses one of its members as mayor and one as mayor-pro-tem. In 2006, this pattern was deviated from when the council decided to have a cycle of three mayors and mayors pro-tem in the coming two years. Malibu does not have a police force. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department provides law enforcement services to Malibu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.malibucity.org/241/Law-Enforcement-Services|title=Law Enforcement – Malibu, CA – Official Website|website=www.malibucity.org|access-date=March 7, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041500/https://www.malibucity.org/241/Law-Enforcement-Services|url-status=live}}</ref>
