It is known for its [[Mediterranean climate]], its strip of beaches stretching 21 miles (34 km) along the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast, and for its long-time status as the home of numerous affluent [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] celebrities and executives. Although a high percentage of its residents are entertainment industry figures with million-dollar mansions, Malibu also features several [[middle-class|middle]] and [[upper-middle class|upper-middle class]] neighborhoods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/woolsey-fires-malibu-community-1203033096/|title=How a Tight-Knit Malibu Community Banded Together in the Face of Wildfires|last=MADDAUS|first=GENE|date=2018-11-20|website=Variety|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> The Pacific Coast Highway ([[California State Route 1|State Route 1]]) traverses the city and has led most residents to settle anywhere from half a mile (0.8 km) to within a few hundred yards of it, with some residents living up to one mile (1.6 km) away from the beach in areas featuring narrow canyons. As of the [[2020 US Census|2020 census]], the city's population was 10,654.

Nicknamed "The 'Bu" by surfers and locals,<ref name="Poole" /><ref name="Taylor" /><ref name="Partridge" /> Malibu is famed for its strip of beaches (incorporated into the city proper in 1991) which includes Big Rock Beach, Broad Beach, [[County Line Beach, Malibu|County Line Beach]], Dan Blocker Beach, La Costa Beach,<ref>[https://www.californiabeaches.com/beach/la-costa-beach/ La Costa Beach]</ref> Las Flores Beach,<ref>[https://www.californiabeaches.com/beach/las-flores-beach/ Las Flores Beach]</ref> Malibu Beach, [[Point Dume|Point Dume Beach]], [[Surfrider Beach]], [[Topanga, California|Topanga Beach]], and [[Zuma Beach]].

==Etymology==
Malibu is named for the [[Ventureño language|Ventureño]] [[Chumash people|Chumash]] settlement of [[Humaliwo]], which translates to "The Surf Sounds Loudly." This pre-colonial village was situated next to [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach|Malibu Lagoon]] and is now part of the State Park.<ref>McCall, Lynne & Rosalind, Perry, red.

==History==
[[File:Adamson House.JPG|thumb|[[Adamson House]], a historic house and gardens, listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places in California|National Register of Historic Places]]]]
[[File:Granville Redmond Malibu Coast Spring.jpg|thumb|"Malibu Coast, Spring" by [[Granville Redmond]], {{Circa|1929}}]]
The area is within the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] territory which extended from the [[San Joaquin Valley]] to [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] to Malibu, as well as several islands off the southern coast of California. The Chumash called the settlement ''Humaliwo''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24435 |title=Humaliwo: An Ethnographic Overview of the Chumash in Malibu |publisher=Parks.ca.gov }}</ref> or "the surf sounds loudly". The city's name derives from this, as the "Hu" syllable is not stressed.

Humaliwo was next to [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach|Malibu Lagoon]] and was an important regional center in prehistoric times. The village, which is identified as CA-LAN-264, was occupied from approximately 2500 BCE. It was the second-largest [[Chumash people|Chumash]] coastal settlement by the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], after Muwu ([[Point Mugu]]). Baptismal records list 118 individuals from Humaliwo. Humaliwo was considered an important political center, but there were additional minor settlements in the area. One village, Ta’lopop, was located few miles up [[Malibu Canyon]] from Malibu Lagoon. Research shows that Humaliwo had ties to other pre-colonial villages, including Hipuk (in [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]]), Lalimanux (by [[Conejo Grade]]) and Huwam (in [[Bell Canyon, California|Bell Canyon]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=24435|title=Humaliwo: An Ethnographic Overview of the Chumash in Malibu|first=California State Parks, State of|last=California|website=CA State Parks}}</ref><ref>Gamble, Lynn H.

Explorer [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] is believed to have moored at Malibu Lagoon, at the mouth of Malibu Creek, to obtain fresh water in 1542. The Spanish presence returned with the [[Spanish missions in California|California mission]] system, and the area was part of [[Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit]]—a {{convert|13000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[land grant]]—in 1802. That ranch passed intact to [[Frederick Hastings Rindge]] in 1891. He and his wife, [[Rhoda May Knight Rindge]], were very staunch about protecting their land. After his death, [[Rhoda May Knight Rindge|Rhoda May]] guarded their property zealously by hiring guards to evict all trespassers and fighting a lengthy court battle to prevent the building of a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific railroad]] line through the ranch. Interstate Commerce Commission regulations would not support a railroad condemning property in order to build tracks that paralleled an existing line, so Frederick H. Rindge decided to build his own railroad through his property first. He died, and May Rindge followed through with the plans, building the [[Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway]]. The line started at Carbon Canyon, just inside the ranch's property eastern boundary, and ran 15 miles westward, past Pt. Dume.<ref>Doyle, Thomas W. et al.

Few roads even entered the area before 1929, when the state won another court case and built what is now known as the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]]. By then May Rindge was forced to divide her property and begin selling and leasing lots. The Rindge house, known as the [[Adamson House]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=672 |title=Adamson House |publisher=Parks.ca.gov }}</ref> (a [[National Register of Historic Places]] site and [[California Historical Landmark]]), is now part of Malibu Creek State Park and is situated between [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=835 |title=Malibu Lagoon State Beach |publisher=Parks.ca.gov |date=January 19, 2005 }}</ref> and Surfrider Beach, beside the Malibu Pier<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24409 |title=Malibu Pier |publisher=Parks.ca.gov }}</ref> that was used to provide transportation to/from the ranch, including construction materials for the Rindge railroad, and to tie up the family's yacht.<ref name="Myrick, David F. pp. 1-53"/><ref>Doyle, Thomas W. and Rindge, Ronald L. ''Malibu Rails and Roads,'' pp. 74, Malibu Lagoon Museum, Malibu, CA, 2012.</ref>

In 1926, in an effort to avoid selling land to stave off insolvency, [[Rhoda May Knight Rindge|May K. Rindge]] created a small ceramic tile factory. At its height, Malibu Potteries employed over 100 workers, and produced decorative tiles which furnish many Los Angeles-area public buildings and [[Beverly Hills]] residences. The factory, located one-half-mile east of the pier, was ravaged by a fire in 1931.<ref>Doyle, Thomas W and Rindge, Ronald L. ''Malibu Rails and Roads: A Photographic Journey Across Rancho Topanga-Malibu-Sequit,'' pp. 78–9, Malibu Adamson House Foundation, Malibu, CA, 2012.</ref> Although the factory partially reopened in 1932, it could not recover from the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and a steep downturn in Southern California construction projects. A distinct hybrid of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and crafts]] designs, Malibu tile is considered highly collectible. Fine examples of the tiles may be seen at the Adamson House and Serra Retreat, a 50-room mansion that was started in the 1920s as the main Rindge home on a hill overlooking the lagoon. The unfinished building was sold to the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] Order in 1942<ref>[http://www.serraretreat.com/about/index.htm Rindge House sold to Franciscans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701172942/http://www.serraretreat.com/about/index.htm |date=July 1, 2014 }} from serraretreat.com</ref> and is operated as a [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] facility,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.serraretreat.com/ |title=Serra Retreat |publisher=Serra Retreat |access-date=November 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202203447/http://www.serraretreat.com/ |archive-date=February 2, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Serra Retreat. It burned in the 1970 fire and was rebuilt using many of the original tiles.

Most of the Big Rock Drive area was bought in 1936 by [[William Randolph Hearst]], who considered building an estate on the property. He sold the lower half of his holdings there in 1944 to Art Jones. Jones was one of the prominent early realtors in Malibu, starting with the initial leases of Rindge land in Malibu Colony. He was also the owner/part-owner of the Malibu Inn, Malibu Trading Post and the Big Rock Beach Cafe (which is now Moonshadows restaurant). Philiip McAnany owned {{convert|80 |acres}} in the upper Big Rock area, which he had purchased in 1919, and had two cabins there, one of which burned in a brush fire that swept through the area in 1959, and the other in the 1993 Malibu fire. McAnany Way is named after him.<ref>Map Books of the Los Angeles County Assessor</ref><ref>Lummis, Jr., Dayton.

=== Malibu Colony ===
Malibu Colony was one of the first areas with private homes after Malibu was opened to development in 1926 by May K. Rindge. Her husband, Frederick Hastings Rindge paid $10 an acre in 1890. <ref>cite web May K. Rindge, a Fighter to the End https://patch.com/california/malibu/may-k-rindge-a-fighter-to-the-end</ref> As one of Malibu's most famous districts,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://malibuca.org/ |title=MalibuCa.org |publisher=MalibuCa.org |access-date=February 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117081148/http://malibuca.org/ |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it is located south of Malibu Road and the Pacific Coast Highway, west of Malibu Lagoon State Beach, east of Malibu Bluffs Park (formerly a state park) and across from the Malibu Civic Center. [[Rhoda May Knight Rindge|May Rindge]] allowed prominent Hollywood movie stars to build vacation homes in the Colony as a defensive public relations wedge against the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] from taking her property under eminent domain for a coastal train route. The action forced the Southern Pacific to route their [[Coast Line (Union Pacific Railroad)|northbound line inland]] then return to the coast in Ventura. However, the long legal battle to protect her beloved Malibu coast had been costly and she eventually died penniless.<ref name="LAT 20160313">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0313-randall-malibu-20160314-story.html |title=The long and complicated fight to preserve paradise in Malibu |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=David K. |last=Randall |date= March 13, 2016 |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Long known as a popular private enclave for wealthy celebrities,<ref>[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Live/Malibu.shtml Celebrities living in Malibu Colony] from seeing-stars.com</ref> the Malibu Colony is a [[gated community]], with multimillion-dollar homes on small lots. The Colony has views of the Pacific Ocean, with coastline views stretching from [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] to [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California|Rancho Palos Verdes]] to the south (known locally as the ''Queen's Necklace''<ref>[http://www.trails.com/rentals/propertyna.asp?vacation=01044_Thousand+Oaks_California Malibu to RPV: Queen's Necklace] from trails.com</ref>) and the bluffs of [[Point Dume]] to the north.

=== High technology in Malibu ===
The first working model of a [[laser]] was demonstrated by [[Theodore Harold Maiman|Theodore Maiman]] in 1960 in Malibu at the [[Hughes Research Laboratories|Hughes Research Laboratory]]<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/6420AP_WA_Obit_Maiman.html Dr. Maiman's laser, the world's first]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from seattlepi.nwsource.com</ref> (now known as HRL Laboratories LLC).

=== Incorporation ===
In 1991 most of the Malibu land grant was incorporated as a city to allow local control of the area (as cities under California law, they are not subject to the same level of county government oversight). Prior to achieving municipal status, the local residents had fought several county-proposed developments, including an offshore freeway,<ref>{{cite news|title=The freeway that never was|work=Malibu Times|date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.malibutimes.com/malibu_life/image_7a26bbac-fa13-11e2-bd99-0019bb2963f4.html|access-date=April 26, 2012|archive-date=August 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806055601/http://www.malibutimes.com/malibu_life/image_7a26bbac-fa13-11e2-bd99-0019bb2963f4.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> a [[nuclear power plant]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Still Generating Controversy|newspaper=LA Times|first= Bob |last=Pool|date=June 14, 2005|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/14/local/me-malibunuke14|access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref> and several plans to replace septic tanks with [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] lines to protect the ocean from seepage that pollutes the marine environment. The incorporation drive gained impetus in 1986, when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved plans for a regional sewer that would have been large enough to serve 400,000 people in the western Santa Monica Mountains. Residents were incensed that they would be assessed taxes and fees to pay for the sewer project, and feared that the Pacific Coast Highway would need to be widened into a freeway to accommodate growth that they did not want. The supervisors fought the incorporation drive and prevented the residents from voting, a decision that was overturned in the courts.

The city councils in the 1990s were unable to write a Local Coastal Plan (LCP) that preserved enough public access to satisfy the [[California Coastal Commission]], as required by the California Coastal Act. The state Legislature eventually passed a Malibu-specific law that allowed the Coastal Commission to write an LCP for Malibu, thus limiting the city's ability to control many aspects of land use. Because of the failure to adequately address [[sewage disposal]] problems in the heart of the city, the local water board ordered Malibu in November 2009 to build a [[sewage plant]] for the Civic Center area. The city council has objected to that solution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_4e823718-43af-11e6-a39e-c36a34ab0860.html |title=Construction Begins on Civic Center Sewer |newspaper=[[Malibu Times]] |first=Arthur |last=Augustyn |date=July 7, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709225633/http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_4e823718-43af-11e6-a39e-c36a34ab0860.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> On February 2, 2007, Civic Center Stormwater Treatment Facility opened.<ref>{{cite web |title=Civic Center Stormwater Treatment Facility |url=https://www.malibucity.org/429/Civic-Center-Stormwater-Treatment-Facili |website=Malibu, CA}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Malibu's Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility Advances with Approvals of Construction Contracts & Land Purchase Agreement |url=https://westsidetoday.com/2016/05/25/malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-advances-approvals-construction-contracts-land-purchase-agreement/ |access-date=21 September 2022 |work=WestsideToday |date=25 May 2016}}</ref> On June 29, 2016, City of Malibu ''Civic Center Wasterwater Treatment Facility'', Phase 1, broke ground.<ref name="youtube=yxJ1h2X8txM">{{cite web |author1=City of Malibu |title=Civic Center Water Treatment Facility Groundbreaking Ceremony |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxJ1h2X8txM |website=youtube |date= 29 June 2016  |access-date=21 September 2022 |language=en |quote=MalibuCity.org/CCWTF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Malibu, City of- Civic Center Wasterwater & Recycling Facility Phase I |url=https://bondaccountability.resources.ca.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectPK=16356&PropositionPK=48 |website=bondaccountability.resources.ca.gov |access-date=21 September 2022 |quote=Actual Completion: 8/1/2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Groundbreaking Ceremony for Malibu's Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility Set for June 29 |url=https://centurycity-westwoodnews.com/groundbreaking-ceremony-for-malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-set-for-june-29/ |website=Century City News |date=22 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Civic Center Water Treatment Facility |url=https://www.malibucity.org/837/Civic-Center-Water-Treatment-Facility |website=malibucity.org |access-date=21 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Malibu's Civic Center Wastewater Treatment Facility Advances with Approvals of Construction Contracts & Land Purchase Agreement |url=https://westsidetoday.com/2016/05/25/malibus-civic-center-wastewater-treatment-facility-advances-approvals-construction-contracts-land-purchase-agreement/ |website=WestsideToday |access-date=21 September 2022 |date=25 May 2016}}</ref>

The eastern end of the city borders the [[Topanga, California|community of Topanga]], which separates it from the city of Los Angeles.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|19.8|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of it land.

Malibu's dry brush and steep clay slopes make it prone to fires, floods, and mudslides.

Point Dume forms the northern end of the [[Santa Monica Bay]], and Point Dume Headlands Park affords a vista stretching to the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]] and [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]]. Directly below the park, on the western side of the point, is Pirates Cove. Because of its relative seclusion, Pirates Cove was previously used as a [[nude beach]], but since nudity is now illegal on all beaches in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], nude sunbathers are subject to fines and/or arrest.

Like all California beaches, Malibu beaches are technically public land below the mean high tide line. Many large public beaches (Zuma Beach, Surfrider Beach) are easily accessible, but such access is sometimes limited for some of the smaller and more remote beaches. Some Malibu beaches are private, such as Paradise Cove, which charges an entrance fee to keep the crowds at bay.<ref>[http://www.ruba.com/place/Paradise_Cove_Beach-anon Review of Paradise Cove] Retrieved November 5, 2009.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207071313/http://www.ruba.com/place/Paradise_Cove_Beach-anon |date=February 7, 2015 }}</ref>

The individuals responsible for starting the fire were later identified, and are the subject of ongoing civil and criminal litigation.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MHS Newspaper Wins National Awards|url=http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_65a12e1c-893c-54ab-8312-287113705392.html|first=Judy-Anne|last=Goldman|publisher=The Malibu Times|work=MalibuTimes.com|date=June 4, 2003|access-date=October 1, 2014|archive-date=June 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625090903/http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_65a12e1c-893c-54ab-8312-287113705392.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/usa/news/article_1376494.php/Malibu_Thanksgiving_weekend_blaze_claims_53_homes Malibu gossip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220023334/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/usa/news/article_1376494.php/Malibu_Thanksgiving_weekend_blaze_claims_53_homes |date=February 20, 2013 }} from monstersandcritics.com</ref>

===Mudslides===
One of the most problematic side-effects of the fires that periodically rage through Malibu is the destruction of vegetation, which normally provides some degree of topographical stability to the loosely packed shale and sandstone hills during periods of heavy precipitation. Rainstorms following large wildfires can thus cause a phenomenon known as mudslides, in which water-saturated earth and rock moves quickly down mountainsides, or entire slices of mountainside abruptly detach and fall downward.

After the 1993 wildfire stripped the surrounding mountains of their earth-hugging [[chaparral]], torrential rainstorms in early 1994 caused a massive mudslide near Las Flores Canyon that closed down the main coastal transport artery, Pacific Coast Highway, for months. Thousands of tons of mud, rocks, and water rained down on the Pacific Coast Highway like a sluicebox. The destruction to property and infrastructure was exacerbated by the narrow constriction of the road at that point, with beachside houses abutting the highway with little or no frontage land acting as a buffer to the mudslide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr107.html |title=Mudslides in Malibu, etc |publisher=Colorado.edu |access-date=November 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713111554/http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr107.html |archive-date=July 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Another large mudslide occurred on Malibu Canyon Road, between the [[Pepperdine University]] campus and HRL Laboratories LLC, closing down Malibu Canyon for two months.<ref>[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/document/weatherhistory.pdf Malibu Mudslides] from noaa.gov</ref> Yet another behemoth slide occurred on another main canyon road, Kanan-Dume Road about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) up the canyon from the Pacific Coast Highway. This last road closure lasted over a period of many months, with Kanan finally fixed by the California Department of Transportation (Cal-Trans)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/ |title=Cal-Trans official web site |publisher=Dot.ca.gov }}</ref> over a year after the road collapse.

Mudslides can and do occur at any time in Malibu, whether a recent fire or rainstorm has occurred or not. Pacific Coast Highway, Kanan-Dume Road, and Malibu Canyon road (as well as many other local roads) have all been prone to many subsequent mudslide-related closures. During any period of prolonged or intense rain, Caltrans snowplows will patrol most canyon roads in the area, clearing mud, rocks, and other fallen debris from the roadways. Such efforts keep most roads passable, but it is nevertheless typical for one or more of the major roads leading into and out of Malibu to be temporarily closed during the rainy season.

===Storms===
Malibu is periodically subjected to intense coastal storms. Occasionally, these storms unearth remnants of the [[Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway|Rindge railroad]] that was built through Malibu in the early 20th century.

On Friday, January 25, 2008, during a storm that was unusually large for the Southern California area, a tornado came ashore and struck a naval base's hangar, ripping off the roof. It was the first tornado to strike Malibu's shoreline in recorded history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Small Tornado Strikes Point Mugu|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2008/jan/25/small-tornado-strikes-point-mugu/|access-date=September 28, 2012|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=January 25, 2008}}</ref>

===Earthquakes===
Malibu is within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of the [[San Andreas Fault]], a fault over {{convert|800|mi|km}} in length that can produce an earthquake over magnitude 8. Several faults are in the region, making the area prone to earthquakes.

The [[Northridge earthquake]] in 1994, and the [[1971 Sylmar earthquake]] (magnitudes 6.7 and 6.6, respectively) shook the area. Smaller earthquakes happen more often.

==Government==

===Municipal government===
Malibu is a general law city governed with a five-member City Council including the mayor and mayor pro tem. The City Council hires a city manager to carry out policies and serve as executive officer. Every even-numbered year either two or three members are elected by the people to serve a four-year term. Usually, the City Council meets in April and chooses one of its members as mayor and one as mayor-pro-tem. In 2006, this pattern was deviated from when the council decided to have a cycle of three mayors and mayors pro-tem in the coming two years. Malibu does not have a police force. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department provides law enforcement services to Malibu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.malibucity.org/241/Law-Enforcement-Services|title=Law Enforcement – Malibu, CA – Official Website|website=www.malibucity.org}}</ref>
