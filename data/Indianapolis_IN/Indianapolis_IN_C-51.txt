Indianapolis(/ˌɪndiəˈnæpəlɪs/ⓘIN-dee-ə-NAP-ə-lis),[10][11]colloquially known asIndy, is thecapitalandmost populous cityof theU.S. stateofIndianaand thecounty seatofMarion County. Indianapolis is situated in the state's centraltill plainregion along the west fork of theWhite River. The city's official slogan, "Crossroads of America", reflects its historic importance as a transportation hub and its relative proximity to other major North American markets.[12][13]
At the2020 census, thebalancepopulation was 887,642.[14]Indianapolis is the16th-most populouscity in the U.S., the third-most populous city in theMidwestafterChicagoandColumbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capital in the nation afterPhoenix,Austin, and Columbus. TheIndianapolis metropolitan areais the33rd-most populousmetropolitan statistical area in the U.S., home to 2.1 million residents.[15]With a population of more than 2.6 million, the combined statistical arearanks 28th.[16]Indianapolis proper covers 368 square miles (950 km2), making it the18th-most extensivecity by land area in the country.
Indigenous peoplesinhabited the area dating to as early as 10,000 BC.[17]In 1818, theLenaperelinquished their tribal lands in theTreaty of St. Mary's.[18]In 1821, Indianapolis was established as aplanned cityfor the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city wasplattedbyAlexander RalstonandElias Pym Fordhamon a 1-square-mile (2.6 km2) grid. Completion of theNationalandMichiganroads and later arrival of rail solidified the city's position as a major manufacturing and commercial center.[19]Since the 1970city-county consolidation, known asUnigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-membercity-county councilheaded by themayor.
Indianapolis anchors the28th largestmetropolitan economy in the U.S.[20]Prominent industries include trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; professional and business services; government; leisure and hospitality; and manufacturing.[21]The city has notableniche marketsinamateur sportsandauto racing.[22][23]Contemporary Indianapolis is home to twomajor leaguesports teams, threeFortune500companies, eight university campuses, and numerous cultural institutions, includingthe world's largest children's museum.[24][25]The city is perhaps best known for hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, theIndianapolis 500.[26][27]Among the city'shistoric sites and districts, Indianapolis is home to the largest collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war casualties in the U.S. outside ofWashington, D.C.[28][29]


### Etymology
The name Indianapolis is derived from pairing the state's name,Indiana(meaning "Land of the Indians", or simply "Indian Land"[30]), with the suffix-polis, theGreekword for "city".Jeremiah Sullivan, justice of theIndiana Supreme Court, is credited with coining the name.[31]Other names considered were Concord, Delaware, Suwarrow,Tecumseh, Wayne, and Whetzel.[32][33]


### History


### Founding and early settlement
In 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, theU.S. Congressdonated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government.[34]Two years later, under theTreaty of St. Mary's(1818), theDelawarerelinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821.[18]This tract of land, which was called theNew Purchase, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820.[35]The indigenous people of the land prior tosystematic removalare theMiami Nation of Indiana(Miami Nation of Oklahoma) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was theTreaty of St. Mary's (1818).[36]
The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers wereProtestants, a large proportion of the earlyIrishandGermanimmigrants wereCatholics. FewAfrican Americanslived in central Indiana before 1840.[37]
The firstEuropean Americansto permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believeGeorge Pogueand family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later calledPogue's Run. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 thatJohn Wesley McCormickand his family and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near theWhite Riverin February 1820.[38]
On January 11, 1820, theIndiana General Assemblyauthorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital.[39]The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821.[1]In April,Alexander RalstonandElias Pym Fordhamwere appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement.[40]Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, whenMarion County, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis was incorporated as a town.[41]
Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847.Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded.[41]Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis fromCorydon, Indiana. In addition to state government offices, aU.S. district courtwas established at Indianapolis in 1825.[42]
Growth occurred with the opening of theNational Roadthrough the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States.[43]A small segment of the ultimately failedIndiana Central Canalwas opened in 1839.[44]The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, theJeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth.[45]Indianapolis Union Stationwas the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853.[46]


### American Civil War
During theAmerican Civil War, Indianapolis was mostly loyal to theUnioncause.GovernorOliver P. Morton, a major supporter ofPresidentAbraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place forUnion armytroops. On February 11, 1861,President-electLincoln arrived in the city, en route toWashington, D.C.for hispresidential inauguration, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history.[47]On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers.[48][49]Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.[50]
Indianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base.[51][52]Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled.[45]An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war.[53]On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing an adjournment of the proceedings, sarcastically referred to as theBattle of Pogue's Run.[54]Fear turned to panic in July 1863, duringMorgan's Raidinto southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east towardOhio, never reaching Indianapolis.[55]On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president'sbierat theIndiana Statehouse.[52][56]


### Industrialization and civic development
Following the Civil War and in the wake of theSecond Industrial Revolution, Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third-largest pork packing city, afterChicagoandCincinnati, and the second-largest railroad center in the U.S. by 1888.[57][58]By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000.[45]Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, includingL. S. Ayres(1872),Eli Lilly and Company(1876),Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company(1910), andAllison Transmission(1915).
Some of the city's most prominent architectural features and best-known historical events date from the turn of the 20th century. TheSoldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol.[59]Ray Harrounwon the inaugural running of theIndianapolis 500, held May 30,1911, atIndianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in theGreat Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths[60][61][62]and the displacement of 7,000 families.[63]
Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaledDetroitas a center of automobile manufacturing.[64]The city was an early focus oflabor organization.[45]TheIndianapolis streetcar strike of 1913and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including aminimum wage, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions.[65]TheInternational Typographical UnionandUnited Mine Workers of Americawere among several influential labor unions based in the city.[45]
As a stop on theUnderground Railroad, Indianapolis had one of the largest black populations in theNorthern States, until theGreat Migration.[66]Led byD. C. Stephenson, theIndiana Klanbecame the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling the City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan.


### Contemporary era
While campaigning in the city in 1968,Robert F. Kennedydelivered one of the most laudedspeechesin 20th century American history, following the assassination ofMartin Luther King Jr.[67][68][69]As in most U.S. cities during thecivil rights movement, the city experienced strained race relations, including1969 riots. A 1971 federal court decision forcingIndianapolis Public Schoolsto implementdesegregation busingproved controversial.[70]
During the mayoral administration ofRichard Lugar(1968–1976), the city and county governments consolidated. Known asUnigov(aportmanteauof "unified" and "government"), thecity-county consolidationremoved bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasinglysuburbanizingtax revenue, and created aRepublicanpolitical machinethat dominated local politics until the early 2000s.[71][72]Effective January 1, 1970, Unigov expanded the city's land area by more than 300 square miles (780 km2) and increased its population by some 250,000 people.[73]It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the U.S. without areferendumsince the creation of theCity of Greater New Yorkin 1898.[74]Lugar is credited with initiating downtown revitalization efforts, overseeing the building ofMarket Square Arena, renovations toIndianapolis City Market, and the formation ofIndiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis.[75]
Amid the changes in government and growth, the city pursued an aggressive economic development strategy to raise the city's stature as asports tourismdestination, known as the Indianapolis Project.[76]During the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor,William Hudnut(1976–1992), millions of dollars were invested into sports venues and public relations campaigns. The strategy was successful in landing theU.S. Olympic Festivalin 1982, securing therelocation of the Baltimore Coltsin 1984, and hosting the1987 Pan American Games.[23]
Beginning in 1992, the mayoral administration ofStephen Goldsmithintroduced a number ofausteritymeasures to address budget shortfalls throughprivatizationand greater reliance onpublic–private partnerships. Major downtown revitalization projects continued through the 1990s, including the openings ofCircle Centre Mall,Victory Field, andGainbridge Fieldhouse, as well as ongoing redevelopment of theCanal and White River State Parkarea.[77]
Bart Petersontook office in 2000, the first Democrat elected to the post sinceJohn J. Barton's1963 election.[78]The Peterson administration focused oneducation reformand promoting the arts. In 2001, the mayor's office became the first in the U.S. to authorizecharter schools.Indianapolis Cultural Districtswere designated in 2003, followed by the groundbreaking of theIndianapolis Cultural Trailin 2007. Further consolidation of city and county units of government resulted in the establishment of theIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Departmentin 2007. Later that year,Greg Ballardsucceeded Peterson in a political upset.[79]
The Ballard administration oversaw the lease of the city's parking meters and the sale of the city's water and wastewater utilities with proceeds financing street repairs. Ballard pursued several environmental sustainability efforts, including establishing an office of sustainability, installing 200 miles (320 km) of bike lanes and trails, and spearheading a controversial deal to start an electriccarsharingprogram.[80][81]Two of the city's largest capital projects, theIndianapolis International Airport's new terminal andLucas Oil Stadium, were completed in 2008.[82][83]In 2012, construction began on a $2 billion tunnel system designed to reduce sewage overflows into the city's waterways.[84]
Since 2016, the administration ofJoe Hogsetthas focused on addressing a rise in gun violence and the city's racial disparities. In recent years, significant capital and operational investments have been made in public safety, criminal justice, and public transit. The city also established rental assistance andfood securityprograms. In 2020, theGeorge Floyd protests in Indianaprompted a series of localpolice reformsand renewed efforts to bolster social services for mental health treatment and homelessness.[85][86]In 2021,a mass shootingoccurred at aFedExfacility on the city's southwest side, killing nine (including the gunman) and injuring seven others.[87][88]


### Geography
Indianapolis is located in theEast North Centralregion of theMidwestern United States, about 14 miles (23 km) south-southeast of Indiana'sgeographic center.[89]It is situated 98 miles (158 km) northwest ofCincinnati, Ohio, 107 miles (172 km) north ofLouisville, Kentucky, 164 miles (264 km) southeast ofChicago, Illinois, and 168 miles (270 km) west ofColumbus, Ohio.[90]According to theU.S. Census Bureau, theIndianapolis (balance)encompasses a total area of 367.9 square miles (953 km2), of which 361.6 square miles (937 km2) is land and 6.3 square miles (16 km2) is water.[3]It is the18th-most extensivecity by land area in the U.S.
As aconsolidated city-county, Indianapolis'scity limitsare coterminous withMarion County, except the autonomous and semi-autonomous municipalities outlined inUnigov.[45][91]Ninecivil townshipsform the broadest geographic divisions within the city and county; these areCenter,Decatur,Franklin,Lawrence,Perry,Pike,Warren,Washington, andWaynetownships.[92]The consolidated city-county borders the adjacent counties ofBooneto the northwest;Hamiltonto the north;Hancockto the east;Shelbyto the southeast;Johnsonto the south;Morganto the southwest; andHendricksto the west.[93]
Between 2.6 million and 11,700 years ago, the Indianapolis area was situated on the southern margin of theLaurentide Ice Sheet. The erosive advance and retreat of glacial ice produced a flat or gently sloping landscape, known as atill plain. Elevations across Indianapolis vary from about 650 feet (198 m) to 900 feet (274 m)above mean sea level.[94]Indianapolis is located in theWest Fork White Riverdrainage basin, part of the largerMississippi Riverwatershed via theWabashandOhiorivers.[95]The White River flows 31 miles (50 km) north-to-south through the city and is fed by some 35 streams, including Eagle Creek,Fall Creek, Pleasant Run, andPogue's Run.[96]The city's largest waterbodies are artificialquarry lakesandreservoirs.


### Cityscape
Indianapolis is an example of aplanned city. In 1821, theIndiana General Assemblyselected a site near theconfluenceof theWhite RiverandFall Creekto serve as the new state capital, adopting a plan co-designed by surveyorsAlexander RalstonandElias Pym Fordham.[97]Thegrid plancalled for a town of 1 square mile (2.6 km2) centered on atraffic circle(from which Indianapolis's "Circle City" nickname originates).[98]Four diagonal avenues—Indiana(northwest), Kentucky (southwest),Massachusetts(northeast), and Virginia (southwest)—radiated a block from the circle.[99]The city's address numbering system originates at the intersection ofWashington(running east–west) andMeridianstreets (running north–south).[100]
In the 2020 census, Indianapolis was among the 20 largest cities in the U.S. by both population and land area; however, the city’s population density of 2,455 people per square mile (948/km2)ranked 222nd. This contrast is evident in Indianapolis's cityscape wherelow-density developmentpatterns dominate and some 14,600 acres (5,900 ha) of farmland remain within its municipal boundaries.[101]
For statistical purposes, the consolidated city-county is organized into 99 "neighborhood areas" with most containing numerous individual historic and cultural districts, subdivisions, and some semi-autonomous towns. In total, some 500 self-identified neighborhood associations are listed in the city's Registered Community Organization system.[102]As a result of the city's expansive land area, Indianapolis has a uniqueurban-to-rural transect, ranging from dense urban neighborhoods to suburbantract housingsubdivisions, to rural villages.[103]
Typical of American cities in the Midwest, Indianapolis urbanized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, resulting in the development of relatively dense, well-defined neighborhoods clustered around streetcar corridors, especially inCenter Township.[104]Notablestreetcar suburbsincludeBroad Ripple,Irvington, andUniversity Heights.[105]Starting in the mid-20th century, thepost–World War II economic expansionand subsequentsuburbanizationgreatly influenced the city's development patterns. From 1950 to 1970, nearly 100,000 housing units were built in Marion County, most outside Center Township in suburban neighborhoods such asCastleton,Eagledale, andNora.[105]
Since the 2000s,downtown Indianapolisand surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment mirroring nationwide market trends, driven byempty nestersandmillennials.[106][107]Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regardinggentrificationandaffordable housing.[108][109][110]According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods likeCottage HomeandFall Creek Placehave experienced measurable gentrification since 2000.[111]TheNorth Meridian Street Historic Districtis among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a meanhousehold incomeof $102,599 in 2017.[112]
More than 260 properties andhistoric districtsare listed on theNational Register of Historic Placesin Marion County, including nineNational Historic Landmarks: theAthenæum (Das Deutsche Haus), theBenjamin Harrison Presidential Site, theBroad Ripple Park Carousel,Hinkle Fieldhouse, theIndiana World War Memorial Plaza, theIndianapolis Motor Speedway, theJames Whitcomb Riley House, theMadam C. J. Walker Building, andOldfields.
The Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission oversees 13 local historic districts and five conservation areas.[113]Notable districts includeChatham–ArchandMassachusetts Avenue,Cottage Home,Cumberland,Fletcher Place,Fountain Square,Herron–Morton Place,Irvington,Lockefield Gardens,Lockerbie Square,Monument Circle,New Augusta, theOld Northside,Ransom Place,St. Joseph, theWholesale District, andWoodruff Place.[114]
The 8-mile (13 km)-longIndiana Central Canalis the oldest extant artificial facility in the city, dating to the 1830s. Between 1985 and 2001, nearly 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of the former canal in downtown Indianapolis were redeveloped into a cultural and recreational amenity. North of 18th Street, the canal retains much of its original appearance, flowing through the northside neighborhoods ofRiverside,Butler–Tarkington,Rocky Ripple, andBroad Ripple. This segment has been recognized as anAmerican Water Landmarksince 1971.[115][116]
Following the dedication of the 284-foot (87 m)Soldiers' and Sailors' Monumentin 1902, Indianapolis enacted its firstheight restriction lawsto protect views of the monument.[citation needed]In 1962, the 372-foot (113 m)City-County Buildingbecame the first high-rise in the city to surpass the monument’s height.[citation needed]The tallest residential buildings in Indianapolis, the twin 295-foot (90 m) 30-floorRiley Towers, were completed in 1963.[117]The 48-floorSalesforce Tower, completed in 1990, is the city’s tallest, with a roof height of 701 feet (214 m). Its distinctive twin antenna masts bring the building’s height to 811 feet (247 m).[118]
Indiana limestonehas been a signature building material in Indianapolis since the 1800s, featured prominently in the city’s monuments, churches, commercial, and civic buildings.[119]Examples includeRoberts Park Methodist Episcopal Church(1876), theIndiana Statehouse(1888), theMajestic Building(1896), theBirch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse(1905),Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral(1907), theIndianapolis Masonic Temple(1909),Old Indianapolis City Hall(1910),Central Library(1917), theScottish Rite Cathedral(1927),Circle Tower(1929), theIndiana World War Memorial(1933), theIndiana State Library and Historical Bureau(1934),Clowes Memorial Hall(1963), andOneAmerica Tower(1982).
The city of Indianapolis maintains 212 public parks, totaling 11,258 acres (4,556 ha) or about 5.1% of the city's land area.[120][121]Eagle Creek Park, Indianapolis's largest and most visited park, ranks among thelargest municipal parksin the U.S., covering 4,766 acres (1,929 ha).[122]Garfield Park, the city's first municipal park, opened in 1876 as Southern Park.[123][124]In the early 20th century, the city enlisted landscape architectGeorge Kesslerto conceive a framework for Indianapolis's modern parks system.[125]Kessler's 1909Indianapolis Park and Boulevard Planlinked notable parks, such asBrookside,Ellenberger, Garfield, andRiverside, with a system of parkways following the city's waterways.[126]The system's 3,474 acres (1,406 ha) were added to theNational Register of Historic Placesin 2003.[127]
Marion County is also home to parks managed by the State of Indiana, includingFort Harrison State ParkandWhite River State Park. Established in 1996, Fort Harrison State Park covers 1,744 acres (706 ha) that are overseen by theIndiana Department of Natural Resources.[128]Since 1979, White River has been owned and operated by the White River State Park Development Commission, a quasi-governmental agency.[129]White River's 250 acres (100 ha) are home to several attractions, including theIndianapolis ZooandWhite River Gardens. Twoland trustsare active in the city managing several sites fornature conservationthroughout the region.[130][131]


### Flora and fauna
Indianapolis is situated in theSouthern Great Lakes forestsecoregionwhich in turn is located within the largertemperate broadleaf and mixed forestsbiome, as defined by theWorld Wide Fund for Nature.[132]Based on theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency'salternative classification system, the city is located in theEastern Corn Belt Plains, an area of the country known for its fertile soil.[133]
Much of thedecidiousforests that once covered 98% of the region wereclearedfor agriculture andurban development, contributing to considerablehabitat loss.[132][134]Indianapolis's current urban tree canopy averages approximately 33%.[135]A rare example ofold-growth forestin the city can be found on 15 acres (6.1 ha) ofCrown Hill Cemetery's North Woods in theButler–Tarkingtonneighborhood.[136]The cemetery's 555 acres (225 ha) represents the largest green space inCenter Township, home to an abundance of wildlife and some 130 species of trees.[137]Native trees most common to the area include varieties ofash,maple, andoak.[132]Severalinvasive speciesare also common in Indianapolis, includingtree of heaven,wintercreeper,Amur honeysuckle, andCallery pear.[138][139]
A 2016bioblitzalong three of the city'sriparian corridorsfound 590taxa.[134]Urban wildlifecommon to the Indianapolis area include mammals such as thewhite-tailed deer,eastern chipmunk,eastern cottontail, and theeastern greyandAmerican red squirrels.[132]In recent years, localraccoonandgroundhogpopulations have increased alongside sightings ofAmerican badgers,beavers,mink,coyotes, andred fox.[140][141]Birds native to the area include thenorthern cardinal,wood thrush,eastern screech owl,mourning dove,pileatedandred-bellied woodpeckers, andwild turkey.[132]Located in theMississippi Flyway, the city sees more than 400 migratory bird species throughout the year.[142][143][144]Some 57 species of fish can be found in the city's waterways, includingbassandsunfish.[96]Some federally-designatedendangeredandthreatened speciesare native to the Indianapolis area, including several species of freshwatermussels, therusty patched bumble bee,Indiana bat,northern long-eared bat, and therunning buffalo clover.[145]
In recent years, theNational Wildlife Federationhas ranked Indianapolis among the ten most wildlife-friendly cities in the U.S.[146]


### Climate
Indianapolis has ahot-summer humid continental climate(Köppen climate classification:Dfa), but can be considered a borderlinehumid subtropical climate(Köppen:Cfa) using the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm. It experiences four distinct seasons.[147]The city lies at the transition betweenUSDAplanthardiness zones6a and 6b.[148]
Typically, summers are fairly hot, humid, and wet. Winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. The July daily average temperature is 75.4 °F (24.1 °C). High temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 18 days each year,[149]and occasionally exceed 95 °F (35 °C). Spring and autumn are usually pleasant, if at times unpredictable. Midday temperature drops exceeding 30 °F or 17 °C are common during March and April, and instances of very warm days (80 °F or 27 °C) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not unusual during these months. Winters are cold, with an average January temperature of 28.1 °F (−2.2 °C). Temperatures dip to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below an average of 3.7 nights per year.[149]
The rainiest months occur in the spring and summer, with slightly higher averages during May, June, and July. May is typically the wettest, with an average of 5.05 inches (12.8 cm) of rain.[149]Most rain is derived from thunderstorm activity.

### Demographics
TheU.S. Census Bureauconsiders Indianapolis as two entities: the consolidated city andthe city's remainder, or balance. The consolidated city is coterminous withMarion County, except the independent municipalities ofBeech Grove,Lawrence,Southport, andSpeedway.[158]The city's balance excludes the populations of ten semi-autonomous municipalities that are included in totals for the consolidated city.[91]These areClermont,Crows Nest,Homecroft,Meridian Hills,North Crows Nest,Rocky Ripple,Spring Hill,Warren Park,Williams Creek, andWynnedale.[158][2]An eleventh town,Cumberland, is partially included.[159][160]
In 2015,Brookingscharacterized the Indianapolis metropolitan area as a minor-emerging immigrant gateway with a foreign-born population of 126,767, or 6.4% of the total population, a 131% increase from 2000.[161]Much of this growth can be attributed to thousands of Burmese-Chin refugees who have settled in Indianapolis, particularlyPerry Township, since the late 1990s.[162]Indianapolis is home to one of the largest concentrations ofChin peopleoutside ofMyanmar(formerly Burma), with an estimated population ranging from 17,000 to 24,000.[163][164][165]
TheWilliams Institutereported that the Indianapolis metropolitan area had an estimated 4.6%LGBTadult population in 2020, totaling about 68,000.[166]
