Columbus(/kəˈlʌmbəs/,kə-LUM-bəs) is thecapitalandmost populous cityof theU.S. stateofOhio. With a2020 censuspopulation of 905,748,[10]it is the14th-most populous cityin the US, the second-most populous city in theMidwest(afterChicago), and the third-most populous US state capital (afterPhoenix, ArizonaandAustin, Texas). Columbus is thecounty seatofFranklin County; it also extends intoDelawareandFairfieldcounties.[11]It is the core city of theColumbus metropolitan area, which encompasses ten counties in central Ohio.[12]It had a population of 2.139 million in 2020, making it thelargest metropolitan areaentirely in Ohio[a]and32nd-largest metro areain the U.S.
Columbus originated as numerous Native American settlements on the banks of theScioto River.Franklinton, now a city neighborhood, was the first European settlement, laid out in 1797. The city was founded in 1812 at theconfluenceof the Scioto andOlentangyrivers, and laid out to become the state capital. The city was named for Italian explorerChristopher Columbus.[14]The city assumed the function of state capital in 1816 and county seat in 1824. Amid steady years of growth and industrialization, the city has experienced numerous floods and recessions. Beginning in the 1950s, Columbus began to experience significant growth; it became the largest city in Ohio in land and population by the early 1990s. Growth has continued in the 21st century, with redevelopment occurring in numerous city neighborhoods, includingDowntown.
The city has a diverse economy without reliance on any one sector. The metropolitan area is home to theBattelle Memorial Institute, the world's largest private research and development foundation;Chemical Abstracts Service, the world's largest clearinghouse of chemical information; and theOhio State University, one of thelargest universities in the United States. The Greater Columbus area is further home to the headquarters of sixFortune 500companies, namelyCardinal Health,American Electric Power,Bath & Body Works, Inc.,Nationwide,Bread FinancialandHuntington Bancshares.


### Name
The city of Columbus was named after 15th-century Italian explorerChristopher Columbusat the city's founding in 1812.[14]It is the largest city in the world named for the explorer, who sailed to and settled parts of the Americas on behalf ofIsabella I of Castileand Spain.[15]Although no reliable history exists as to why Columbus, who had no connection to the city or state of Ohio before the city's founding, was chosen as the name for the city, the bookColumbus: The Story of a Cityindicates a state lawmaker and local resident admired the explorer enough to persuade other lawmakers to name the settlement Columbus.[14][16]
Since the late 20th century, historians have criticized Columbus for initiatingthe European conquest of Americaand for abuse, enslavement, and subjugation of natives.[17][18]Efforts to remove symbols related to the explorer in the city date to the 1990s.[16]Amid theGeorge Floyd protestsin 2020, several petitions pushed for the city to be renamed.[19]
Nicknames for the city have included "the Discovery City",[20]"Arch City",[21][22][23]"Cap City",[24][25]"Cowtown", "The Biggest Small Town in America"[26][27][28]and "Cbus."[29]


### History


### Ancient and early history
Between 1000 B.C. and 1700 A.D., the Columbus metropolitan area was a center to indigenous cultures known as theMound Builders, including theAdena,HopewellandFort Ancientpeoples. Remaining physical evidence of the cultures are their burial mounds and what they contained. Most of Central Ohio's remaining mounds are located outside of Columbus city boundaries, though theShrum Moundis maintained, now as part of a public park and historic site. The city's Mound Street derives its name from a mound that existed by the intersection of Mound andHigh Streets. The mound's clay was used in bricks for most of the city's initial brick buildings; many were subsequently used in theOhio Statehouse. The city'sOhio History Centermaintains a collection of artifacts from these cultures.[30]


### 18th century
The area including present-day Columbus once comprised theOhio Country,[31]under the nominal control of theFrench colonial empirethrough the Viceroyalty ofNew Francefrom 1663 until 1763.
In the 18th century, European traders flocked to the area, attracted by thefur trade.[32]The area was often caught between warring factions, including American Indian and European interests. In the 1740s, Pennsylvania traders overran the territory until the French forcibly evicted them.[33]Fighting for control of the territory in theFrench and Indian War(1754–1763) became part of the internationalSeven Years' War(1756–1763). During this period, the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres and battles. The 1763Treaty of Parisceded the Ohio Country to theBritish Empire.
Up until theAmerican Revolution, Central Ohio had continuously been the home of numerous indigenous villages. AMingovillage was located at the forks of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, with Shawnee villages to the south and Wyandot and Delaware villages to the north. Colonial militiamen burned down the Mingo village in 1774 during a raid.[34]
After the American Revolution, theVirginia Military Districtbecame part of the Ohio Country as a territory of Virginia. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an emptyfrontier, they encountered people of theMiami,Delaware,Wyandot,ShawneeandMingonations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisiveBattle of Fallen Timbersresulted in theTreaty of Greenvillein 1795, which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young surveyor from Virginia namedLucas Sullivanthad founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers. An admirer ofBenjamin Franklin, Sullivant chose to name his frontier village "Franklinton."[35]The location was desirable for its proximity to the navigable rivers – but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large flood wiped out the new settlement.[36]He persevered, and the village was rebuilt, though somewhat more inland.
After the Revolution, land comprising parts of Franklin and adjacent counties was set aside by theUnited States Congressfor settlement byCanadiansandNova Scotianswho were sympathetic to the colonial cause and had their land and possessions seized by the British government. TheRefugee Tract, consisting of 103,000 acres (42,000 ha), was 42 miles (68 km) long and 3–4.5 miles (4.8–7.2 km) wide, and was claimed by 67 eligible men. The Ohio Statehouse sits on land once contained in the Refugee Tract.[37]


### 19th century
AfterOhioachieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving fromChillicothetoZanesvilleand back again. Desiring to settle on a location, the state legislature consideredFranklinton,Dublin,WorthingtonandDelawarebefore compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. As well, Franklinton landowners had donated two 10-acre (4.0 ha) plots in an effort to convince the state to move its capital there.[38]The two spaces were set to becomeCapitol Square, including for theOhio Statehouseand theOhio Penitentiary. Named in honor ofChristopher Columbus, the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the "High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge."[39]At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.[40]
The city was incorporated as a borough on February 10, 1816.[1]Nine people were elected to fill the municipality's various positions of mayor, treasurer and several others.
Between 1816 and 1817,Jarvis W. Pikeserved as the first appointed mayor. Although the recentWar of 1812had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal, with frequent bouts of fevers, attributed tomalariafrom the flooding rivers, and an outbreak ofcholerain 1833. It led Columbus to create the Board of Health, now part of theColumbus Public Healthdepartment. The outbreak, which remained in the city from July to September 1833, killed 100 people.[41]
Columbus was without direct river or trail connections to other Ohio cities, leading to slow initial growth. TheNational Roadreached Columbus fromBaltimorein 1831, which complemented the city's new link to theOhio and Erie Canal, both of which facilitated a population boom.[42][41]A wave of Europeanimmigrantsled to the creation of two ethnicenclaveson the city's outskirts. A largeIrishpopulation settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while theGermanstook advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as theDas Alte Südende(The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries,Trinity Lutheran SeminaryandCapital University.[43]
With a population of 3,500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. On that day, the legislature carried out aspecial act, which granted legislative authority to thecity counciland judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosingJohn Brooksas the first popularly elected mayor.[44]Columbus annexed the then-separate city of Franklinton in 1837.[45]
In 1850, theColumbus and Xenia Railroadbecame the first railroad into the city, followed by theCleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroadin 1851. The two railroads built a jointUnion Stationon the east side of High Street just north of Naghten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased: by 1875, eight railroads served Columbus, and the rail companies built a new, more elaborate station.[46]Another cholera outbreak hit Columbus in 1849, prompting the opening of the city'sGreen Lawn Cemetery.[47]
On January 7, 1857, theOhio Statehousefinally opened after 18 years of construction.[48]Site construction continued until 1861.
Before the abolition of slavery in theSouthern United Statesin 1863, theUnderground Railroadwas active in Columbus and was led, in part, byJames Preston Poindexter.[49]Poindexter arrived in Columbus in the 1830s and became a Baptist preacher and leader in the city's African-American community until the turn of the century.[50]
During theCivil War, Columbus was a major base for the volunteerUnion Army. It housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000Confederateprisoners of waratCamp Chase, at what is nowthe Hilltopneighborhood of west Columbus. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the North's largest Confederate cemeteries.[51]North of Columbus, along the Delaware Road, theRegular ArmyestablishedCamp Thomas, where the18th U.S. Infantryorganized and trained.
By virtue of theMorrill Act of 1862, the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College – which eventually became theOhio State University– was founded in 1870 on the former estate of William and Hannah Neil.[52]
By the end of the 19th century, Columbus was home to several major manufacturing businesses. The city became known as the "Buggy Capital of the World," thanks to the two dozenbuggyfactories – notably theColumbus Buggy Company, founded in 1875 by C.D. Firestone.[53]The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time and might have achieved even greater success were it not for theAnti-Saloon Leaguein neighboringWesterville.[54]
In thesteel industry, a forward-thinking man namedSamuel P. Bushpresided over theBuckeye Steel CastingsCompany. Columbus was also a popular location for labor organizations. In 1886,Samuel Gompersfounded theAmerican Federation of Laborin Druid's Hall on South Fourth Street, and in 1890, theUnited Mine Workers of Americawas founded atthe old City Hall.[55]In 1894,James Thurber, who would go on to an illustrious literary career in Paris and New York City, was born in the city. Today, Ohio State's theater department has a performance center named in his honor, and his childhood home, theThurber House, is located in the Discovery District and is on theNational Register of Historic Places.


### 20th century
Columbus earned one of its nicknames, "The Arch City," because of thedozens of wooden archesthat spanned High Street at the turn of the 20th century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the newstreetcars. The city tore down the arches and replaced them with cluster lights in 1914 but reconstructed them from metal inthe Short Northneighborhood in 2002 for their unique historical interest.[56]
On March 25, 1913, theGreat Flood of 1913devastated the neighborhood of Franklinton, leaving over 90 people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent flooding, theArmy Corps of Engineersrecommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges and building aretaining wallalong its banks. With the strength of the post-World War Ieconomy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a newcivic center, theOhio Theatre, theAmerican Insurance Union Citadeland to the north, a massive newOhio Stadium.[57]Although theAmerican Professional Football Associationwas founded inCantonin 1920, its head offices moved to Columbus in 1921 to theNew Hayden Buildingand remained in the city until 1941.
In 1922, the association's name was changed to theNational Football League.[58]Nearly a decade later, in 1931, at a convention in the city, theJehovah's Witnessestook that name by which they are known today.
The effects of theGreat Depressionwere less severe in Columbus, as the city's diversified economy helped it fare better than itsRust Beltneighbors.World War IIbrought many new jobs and another population surge. This time, most new arrivals were migrants from the "extraordinarily depressed rural areas" ofAppalachia, who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus's growing population.[59]In 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Center opened in suburbanWhitehall, and it is now regarded as one of the first modern shopping centers in the United States.[60]
The construction of theInterstate Highway Systemsignaled the arrival of rapid suburb development in central Ohio. To protect the city's tax base from this suburbanization, Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups toannexationto the city.[61]By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio's largest city in land area and in population.
Efforts to revitalizedowntown Columbushave had some success in recent decades,[62]though like most major American cities, some architectural heritage was lost in the process. In the 1970s, landmarks such asUnion Stationand theNeil Househotel were razed to construct high-rise offices and big retail space. ThePNC Bank buildingwas constructed in 1977, as well as theNationwide Plazabuildings and other towers that sprouted during this period. The construction of theGreater Columbus Convention Centerhas brought major conventions and trade shows to the city.


### 21st century
TheScioto Milebegan development along the riverfront, an area that already had theMiranova Corporate CenterandThe Condominiums at North Bank Park.
The2010 United States foreclosure crisisforced the city to purchase numerous foreclosed, vacant properties to renovate or demolish them – at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. In February 2011, Columbus had 6,117 vacant properties, according to city officials.[63]
Since 2010, Columbus has been growing in population and economy; from 2010 to 2017, the city added 164,000 jobs, which ranked second in the United States.[citation needed]In February and March 2020,Columbus reportedits first official cases ofCOVID-19and declared a state of emergency, with all nonessential businesses closed statewide. There were 69,244 cases of the disease across the city, as of March 11, 2021[update].[64]Later in 2020, protests over themurder of George Floydtook place in the cityfrom May 28 into August.[65]Columbus and its metro area have experienced growth in thehigh-tech manufacturingsector, withIntelannouncing plans to construct a $20 billion factory andHondaexpanding its presence along withLG Energy Solutionswith a $4.4 billion battery manufactory facility inFayette County.[66][67]
TheCOVID-19 pandemicmuted activity in Columbus, especially in its downtown core, from 2020 to 2022. By late 2022, foot traffic inDowntown Columbusbegan to exceed pre-pandemic rates; one of the quickest downtown areas to recover in the United States.[68]
On June 23, 2023, ten people were injured ina mass shootingin the city'sShort Northdistrict.
In July 2024, Columbus was subject to aransomwareattack, for which the hacker groupRhysidiatook credit.[69]In August 2024, Columbus MayorAndrew Gintherclaimed that the files obtained by Rhysidia were "unusable" to the thieves due to being eitherencryptedorcorrupted.[70]Ginther's assertion was subsequently shown to be false by security researcher David Leroy Ross (who goes by the alias Connor Goodwolf), who revealed that the files were intact and contained data including names fromdomestic violencecases andSocial Security numbersof crime victims.[71]Columbus then sued Ross for alleged criminal acts, negligence, and civil conversion, as well as taking out arestraining orderagainst Ross, both of which actions were later defended by City Attorney Zach Klein.[72]In response, a number of prominent cybersecurity researchers called on the city to drop the lawsuit.[73]


### Geography
The confluence of theSciotoandOlentangyrivers is just northwest ofDowntown Columbus. Several smaller tributaries course through theColumbus metropolitan area, includingAlum Creek,Big Walnut CreekandDarby Creek. Columbus is considered to have relatively flattopographythanks to a largeglacierthat covered most of Ohio during theWisconsin Ice Age. However, there are sizable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being 1,132 ft (345 m)above sea levelnearNew Albany, and the low point being 670 ft (200 m) where the Scioto River leaves the county nearLockbourne.[74]
Several ravines near the rivers and creeks also add variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto River cut through limestone. The numerous rivers and streams beside low-lying areas in Central Ohio contribute to a history of flooding in the region; the most significant was theGreat Flood of 1913 in Columbus, Ohio.[75]
The city has a total area of 223.11 square miles (577.85 km2), of which 217.17 square miles (562.47 km2) is land and 5.94 square miles (15.38 km2) is water.[76]Columbus currently has the largest land area of any Ohio city; this is due toJim Rhodes's tactic to annex suburbs while serving as mayor. As surrounding communities grew or were constructed, they came to require access to waterlines, which was under the sole control of the municipal water system. Rhodes told these communities that if they wanted water, they would have to submit to assimilation into Columbus.[77]


### Neighborhoods
Columbus has a wide diversity of neighborhoods with different characters,[78]and is thus sometimes known as a "city of neighborhoods."[79][80]Some of the most prominent neighborhoods include theArena District, theBrewery District,Clintonville,Franklinton,German Village,The Short NorthandVictorian Village.[78]


### Climate
The city's climate ishumid continental(Köppen climate classificationDfa) transitional with thehumid subtropical(Köppen climate classificationCfa) to the south characterized by warm, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. Columbus is withinUSDAhardiness zone6b, bordering on 7a. Winter snowfall is relatively light, since the city is not in the typical path of strong winter lows, such as theNor'eastersthat strike cities farther east. It is also too far south and west forlake-effect snowfromLake Erieto have much effect, although the lakes to the north contribute to long stretches of cloudy spells in winter.
The highest temperature recorded in Columbus is 106 °F (41 °C), which occurred twice during theDust Bowlof the 1930s: once on July 21, 1934, and again on July 14, 1936.[81]The lowest recorded temperature was −22 °F (−30 °C), occurring onJanuary 19, 1994.[81]
Columbus is subject tosevere weathertypical to theMidwestern United States. Severe thunderstorms can bringlightning, largehailand on rare occasionstornadoes, especially during the spring and sometimes through fall. A tornado that occurred on October 11, 2006, causedF2damage.[82]Floods, blizzards and ice storms can also occur from time to time.

### Population makeup
Columbus historically had a significant population ofwhite people. In 1900, whites made up 93.4% of the population.[94]AlthoughEuropeanimmigration has declined, the Columbus metropolitan area has recently experienced increases inAfrican,AsianandLatin Americanimmigration, including groups fromMexico,India,Nepal,Bhutan,SomaliaandChina. While the Asian population is diverse, the city's Hispanic community is mainly made up ofMexican Americans, although there is a notablePuerto Ricanpopulation.[102]Many other countries of origin are represented in lesser numbers, largely due to the international draw ofOhio State University. 2008 estimates indicate that roughly 116,000 of the city's residents are foreign-born, accounting for 82% of the new residents between 2000 and 2006 at a rate of 105 per week.[103]40% of the immigrants came from Asia, 23% from Africa, 22% from Latin America and 13% from Europe.[103]The city had the second-largest Somali andSomali Americanpopulation in the country, as of 2004, as well as the largest expatriateBhutanese-Nepalipopulation in the world, as of 2018.[104][105]
Due to its demographics, which include a mix of races and a wide range of incomes, as well as urban, suburban and nearby rural areas, Columbus is considered a "typical" American city, leadingretail and restaurant chainsto use it as atest marketfor new products.[106]For similar reasons, the city was chosen as the launch city for theQUBEcable television service.
Columbus has maintained a steady population growth since its establishment. Its slowest growth, from 1850 to 1860, is primarily attributed to the city's cholera epidemic in the 1850s.[107]
According to the 2017 Japanese Direct Investment Survey by theConsulate-General of Japan, Detroit, 838Japanese nationals lived in Columbus, making it the municipality with the state's second-largest Japanese national population, afterDublin.[108]
Columbus is home to a proportionalLGBTcommunity, with an estimated 34,952 gay, lesbian or bisexual residents.[109]The 2018American Community Survey(ACS) reported an estimated 366,034 households, 32,276 of which were held by unmarried partners. 1,395 of these were female householder and female-partner households, and 1,456 were male householder and male-partner households.[110]Columbus has been rated as one of the best cities in the country for gays and lesbians to live, and also as the most underrated gay city in the country.[111]In July 2012, three years prior to legalsame-sex marriage in the United States, the Columbus City Council unanimously passed a domestic partnership registry.[112]
Columbus has numerousItalian Americans, with groups including the Columbus Italian Club, Columbus Piave Club and the Abruzzi Club.[113]Italian Village, a neighborhood near Downtown Columbus, has had a prominent Italian American community since the 1890s.[114]
The community has helped promote the influenceChristopher Columbushad in drawing European attention to the Americas. The Italian explorer, erroneously credited with the lands' discovery, has been posthumously criticized by historians for initiating colonization and for abuse, enslavement and subjugation of natives.[18][17]In addition to the city being named for the explorer, its seal andflagdepict a ship he used for his first voyage to the Americas, theSanta María. A similar-size replica of the ship, theSanta Maria Ship & Museum, was displayed downtown from 1991 to 2014.[115]The city'sDiscovery DistrictandDiscovery Bridgeare named in reference to Columbus's "discovery" of the Americas; the bridge includes artistic bronze medallions featuring symbols of the explorer.[116][117]Genoa Park, downtown, is named afterGenoa, the birthplace of Christopher Columbus and one of Columbus'ssister cities.[118]
The Christopher Columbus Quincentennial Jubilee, celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage, was held in the city in 1992. Its organizers spent $95 million on it, creating the horticultural exhibitionAmeriFlora '92. The organizers also planned to create a replica Native American village, among other attractions. Local and national native leaders protested the event with a day of mourning, followed by protests and fasts at City Hall. The protests prevented the native village from being exhibited, and annual fasts continued until 1997. A protest also took place during the dedication of theSanta Mariareplica, an event held in late 1991 on the day beforeColumbus Dayand in time for the jubilee.[16][14]
The city has three outdoor statues of the explorer; thestatue at City Hallwas acquired, delivered and dedicated with the assistance of the Italian American community. Protests in 2017 aimed for this statue to be removed,[119]followed by the city in 2018 ceasing to recognizeColumbus Dayas a city holiday.[120]During the 2020George Floyd protests, petitions were created to remove all three statues and rename the city of Columbus.[19]Two of the statues – one at City Hall and the other at Columbus State Community College – were removed, while the city is also looking into changing its flag and seal to remove the reference to Christopher Columbus. As of 2024[update]the third statue at the Ohio Statehouse remains in place.
The city was one of eight cities to be offered the 360 ft (110 m)Birth of the New Worldstatue, in 1993. The statue, also of Christopher Columbus, was completed in Puerto Rico in 2016 and is thetallest in the United States– 45 ft (14 m) taller than theStatue of Liberty, including its pedestal. At least six U.S. cities, including Columbus, rejected it based on its height and design.[121]


### Religion
According to the 2019American Values Atlas, 26% of Columbus metropolitan area residents are unaffiliated with a religious tradition. 17% of area residents identify as White evangelical Protestants, 14% as White mainline Protestants, 11% as Black Protestants, 11% as White Catholics, 5% as Hispanic Catholics, 3% as other nonwhite Catholics, 2% as other nonwhite Protestants and 2% as Mormons. Hindus, Buddhists, Jews and Latino Protestants each made up 1% of the population, while Jehovah's Witnesses, Orthodox Christians, Muslims, Unitarians, and members of New Age or other religions each made up under 0.5% of the population.[122]
Places of worship include Baptist, Evangelical, Greek Orthodox, Latter-day Saints, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Quaker, Roman Catholic, and Unitarian Universalist churches. Columbus also hosts several Islamic mosques, Jewish synagogues, Buddhist centers, Hindu temples and a branch of theInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness. Religious teaching institutions include thePontifical College Josephinumand several private schools led by Christian organizations.


### Economy
Columbus has a generally strong and diverse economy based on education, insurance, banking, fashion, defense, aviation, food, logistics, steel, energy, medical research, health care, hospitality, retail and technology. In 2010, it was one of the 10 best big cities in the country, according to Relocate America, a real estate research firm.[123]
According to theFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the GDP of Columbus in 2019 was $134 billion (~$158 billion in 2023).[124]
During theGreat Recessionbetween 2007 and 2009, Columbus's economy was not impacted as much as the rest of the country, due to decades of diversification work by long-time corporate residents, business leaders and political leaders. The administration of former mayorMichael B.

TheInterstate 270Outerbeltencircles most of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of theInterstate 670spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70),State Route 315on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a two- or three-hour drive of Columbus.
The Columbus riverfront hosts several bridges. TheDiscovery Bridgeconnects downtown to Franklinton across Broad Street. The bridge opened in 1992, replacing a 1921 concrete arch bridge; the first bridge at the site was built in 1816.[208]The 700 ft (210 m)Main Street Bridgeopened on July 30, 2010.[209]The bridge has three lanes for vehicular traffic (one westbound and two eastbound) and another separated lane for pedestrians and bikes. TheRich Street Bridgeopened in July 2012 adjacent to the Main Street Bridge, connecting Rich Street on the east side of the river with Town Street on the west.[210][211]TheLane Avenue Bridgeis acable-stayed bridgethat opened on November 14, 2003, in the University District. The bridge spans the Olentangy River with three lanes of traffic each way.
The city's primary airport,John Glenn Columbus International Airport, is on the city's east side. Formerly known as Port Columbus, John Glenn provides service toToronto, Ontario, Canada, andCancun, Mexico(on a seasonal basis), as well as to most domestic destinations, including all the major hubs along withSan Francisco,Salt Lake CityandSeattle. The airport was a hub fordiscount carrierSkybus Airlinesand continues to be home toNetJets, the world's largestfractional ownershipair carrier. According to a 2005 market survey, John Glenn Columbus International Airport attracts about 50% of its passengers from outside of its 60-mile (97 km) radius primary service region.[212]It is the 52nd-busiest airport in the United States by total passenger boardings.[213]
Rickenbacker International Airport, in southern Franklin County, is a major cargo facility that is used by the OhioAir National Guard.Allegiant Airoffers nonstop service from Rickenbacker toFloridadestinations.Ohio State University Don Scott AirportandBolton Fieldare other large general-aviation facilities in the Columbus area.
In 1907, 14-year-oldCromwell Dixonbuilt theSkyCycle,a pedal-powered blimp, which he flew atDriving Park.[214]Three years later, one of theWright brothers' exhibition pilots, Phillip Parmalee, conducted the world's first commercial cargo flight when he flew two packages containing 88 kilograms of silk 70 miles (110 km) from Dayton to Columbus in aWright Model B.[215]
Military aviators from Columbus distinguished themselves during World War I. Six Columbus pilots, led by topaceEddie Rickenbacker, achieved 42 "kills" – a full 10% of all US aerial victories in the war, and more than the aviators of any other American city.[216]
After the war, Port Columbus Airport (now known asJohn Glenn Columbus International Airport) became the axis of a coordinated rail-to-air transcontinental system that moved passengers from the East Coast to the West. TAT, which later becameTWA, provided commercial service, followingCharles Lindbergh's promotion of Columbus to the nation for such a hub. Following the failure of a bond levy in 1927 to build the airport, Lindbergh campaigned in the city in 1928, and the next bond levy passed that year.[214]On July 8, 1929, the airport opened for business with the inaugural TAT westbound flight from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma. Among the 19 passengers on that flight wasAmelia Earhart,[214]withHenry FordandHarvey Firestoneattending the opening ceremonies.[214]
In 1964, Ohio nativeGeraldine Fredritz Mockbecame the first woman to fly solo around the world, leaving from Columbus and piloting theSpirit of Columbus. Her flight lasted nearly a month and set a record for speed for planes under 3,858 pounds (1,750 kg).[217]
Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called theCentral Ohio Transit Authority(COTA). The service operates41 routeswith a fleet of 440 buses, serving approximately 19 million passengers per year. COTA operates 23 regular fixed-service routes, 14 express services, abus rapid transitroute, a free downtown circulator, night service, an airport connector and other services.[218]LinkUS, an initiative between COTA, the city, and theMid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission, is planning to add more rapid transit to Columbus, with three proposed corridors operating by 2030, and potentially a total of five by 2050.
Intercity bus service is provided at theColumbus Bus StationbyGreyhound,Barons Bus Lines, Miller Transportation,GoBusand other carriers.[219]
Columbus does not have passenger rail service. The city's major train station,Union Station, was a stop alongAmtrak'sNational Limitedtrain service until 1977 and was razed in 1979,[220]and theGreater Columbus Convention Centernow stands in its place. Until Amtrak's founding in 1971, thePenn Centralran theCincinnati Limitedto Cincinnati to the southwest (in prior years the train continued to New York City to the east); theOhio State LimitedbetweenCincinnatiandCleveland, with Union Station serving as a major intermediate stop (the train going unnamed between 1967 and 1971); and theSpirit of St. Louis,which ran between St. Louis and New York City until 1971. The station was also a stop along thePennsylvania Railroad, theNew York Central Railroad, theChesapeake and Ohio Railway, theBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, theNorfolk and Western Railway, theCleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, and thePittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. As the city lacks local, commuter or intercity trains, Columbus is now the largest city and metropolitan area in the U.S. without any passenger rail service.[221][222]Numerous proposals to return rail service have been introduced; currently Amtrak plans to restore service to Columbus by 2035.
Cyclingas transportation is steadily increasing in Columbus with its relatively flat terrain, intact urban neighborhoods, large student population and off-road bike paths. The city has put forth the 2012 Bicentennial Bikeways Plan, as well as a move toward a Complete Streets policy.[223][224]Grassroots efforts such as Bike to Work Week, Consider Biking, Yay Bikes,[225]Third Hand Bicycle Co-op,[226]Franklinton Cycleworks andCranksters, a local radio program focused on urban cycling,[227]have contributed to cycling as transportation.
Columbus also hostsurban cycling"off-shots" with messenger-style "alleycat" races, as well as unorganized group rides, a monthlyCritical Massride,[228]bicycle polo, art showings, movie nights and a variety ofbicycle-friendlybusinesses and events throughout the year. All this activity occurs despite Columbus's frequently inclement weather.
TheMain Street Bridge, opened in 2010, features a dedicated bike and pedestrian lane separated from traffic.
The city has its ownpublic bicycle system.CoGo Bike Sharehas a network of about 600 bicycles and 80 docking stations.PBSC Urban Solutions, a company based inCanada, supplies technology and equipment.[229][230]Bird electric scootershave also been introduced.[231]
