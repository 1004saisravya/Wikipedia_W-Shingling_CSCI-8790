City of Alameda

Alameda
 is a city located in 
Alameda County, California
. It is a city on a small island of the same name next to 
Oakland
, 
California
 in the 
San Francisco Bay
. An additional part of the city is on 
Bay Farm Island
, which it shares with the 
Oakland International Airport
. The city has a small town feel with its Victorian homes and tree lined neighborhoods. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 72,259.

Today the city consists of the main original section, with the former 
Naval Air Station
 at one end, and 
Bay Farm Island
, which is actually part of the mainland proper. Both of these are built on artificial hydraulic landfill on top of the bay's muddy bottom. The area of the former NAS is now known as "Alameda Point."

History
[
edit
]

The city was founded on June 6, 1853. Alameda was not originally on an island; rather, it was a peninsula off Oakland. The need for expanded shipping facilities in the late 19th century in both cities led to a shipping and tidal channel that was dug between the two cities in 1902, extending and deepening the natural estuary, which resulted in Alameda becoming an "island" with most of the dug up soil used to fill in some sections of the nearby marsh land.

Transportation
[
edit
]

Vehicle access to the island is via three bridges to Oakland, a bridge to Bay Farm Island, and two one-way tunnels leading into Oakland's Chinatown. Bridges at Fruitvale Avenue, High Street, and Park Street, and the tunnels at Webster Street and Harrison Street (the latter called the 
Posey Tube
) connect Alameda and Oakland. Public transportation includes the 
AC Transit
 buses (which include express buses to 
San Francisco
) and two ferry services--the 
Alameda-Oakland Ferry
 and the 
Harbor Bay Ferry
. Both ferry services may be transferred to the 
Water Transit Authority
 shortly. The island is also close to the 
BART
 train service.

Even though the island is just minutes off 
Interstate 880
, the speed limit for the city is 25 mph (40 km/h) on almost every road. Many unaware drivers fail to slow down after exiting the highway. Groups like Pedestrian Friendly Alameda and BikeAlameda advocate stronger enforcement of speeding laws.

Attractions
[
edit
]

Due to its proximity to the Bay, 
wind surfers
 and 
kite surfers
 can often be seen along Crown Memorial State Beach and Shoreline Drive. From the beach there are also have views of the 
San Francisco
 skyline and the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
.

One of the recent attractions is the 
aircraft carrier
 
USS 
Hornet
, a 
museum ship
 now moored at the former 
Naval Air Station
.

Economic development
[

File:Afl new.jpg
The New Alameda Free Library
The Alameda Theater as of February 2006
 The Naval Air Station Alameda was decomissioned and is in process of being turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as "Alameda Point". Portions of Alameda Point are now in commercial use, but the transfer process has been slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the City regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land. Development of the base is also opposed by a vocal minority in the City who object to modifications to a ballot measure passed in the 1970's that intended to stop a practice then popular in the City of tearing down the island's beautiful, historical Victorian homes and replacing them with apartment complexes.

After two previous failures, voters in the City passed a ballot measure in 
2000
 authorizing a 
bond measure
 for construction of a new library to replace the city's 
Carnegie library
 that was damaged during the 
Loma Prieta earthquake
. The City also received state funds for the new library and it is currently under construction near the City's Park Street business district and will open in the fall of 2006.

City officials continue to seek ways to spur economic development on the Island including the reconstruction of the City's shopping mall and restoration of the historic art deco city landmark Alameda Theater. The theater restoration project is currently the subject of much controversy in the City, pitting the City's pro-development and anti-development factions against each other once again.

Alameda Power and Telecom
[
edit
]

Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power and telecommunications service (Alameda Power and Telecom) that delivers services directly to consumers. The telecommunications service has the potential of far exceeding the capabilities of the various cable and DSL providers in the larger region.

There have been proposals by the power producer to produce energy from waste, but not within the city of Alameda. Instead this energy would be produced at a waste transfer station located in neighboring (and downwind) 
San Leandro
. Owing to the expected release of toxic emissions from what is essentially a 
garbage
 
incinerator
, the mayor and city council of San Leandro rejected the proposal. The mayor vowed to fight this proposal, suggesting that Alameda could instead place this near their municipal golf course.

Also, unlike the three major power producers in California, Alameda is not required to establish 
net metering
 for home 
photovoltaic
 power producers, so the city currently lags far behind other communities in producing truly "green" energy, even though they have a potentially productive site for supplemental wind energy on the western edge of the former naval air station.
