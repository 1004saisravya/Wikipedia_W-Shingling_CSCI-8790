The city of Alameda highlighted within 
Alameda County

Alameda
 is a city located in 
Alameda County, California
.  It is a city on a small island of the same name next to 
Oakland
, 
California
 in the 
San Francisco Bay
. An additional part of the city is on 
Bay Farm Island
, which it shares with the 
Oakland International Airport
.  The city has a small town feel with its Victorian homes and tree lined neighborhoods. As of the 
2000
 census, the city had a total population of 72,259. The city was founded on June 6, 1853.

Alameda was not originally an island as it was originally a land extension of Oakland. The need for expanded shipping facilities in the late 19th century in both cities, led to a shipping and tidal channel that was dug between the two cities in 
1902
 leading to Alameda becoming an "island" with most of the dug up soil used to fill in some sections of Alameda.

Today the island consists of the main original section that is bookended  by the former 
Naval Air Station
 and 
Bay Farm Island
 which is actually part of the mainland proper. Both of these ends are built on artificial hydraulic landfill on top of the bay's muddy bottom.

The Naval Air Station Alameda was decomissioned and is in process of being turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as "Alameda Point". Portions of Alameda Point are now in commercial use, but the transfer process has been slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the City regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.

Vehicle access to the island is via three bridges to Oakland, a bridge to Bay Farm Island, and two one-way tunnels to Oakland's Chinatown.  The bridges at Fruitvale Ave, High Street and Park Street and the tunnels at Webster Street and Harrison Street (the latter called the "Posey tube") connect Alameda and Oakland. Public transportation includes the 
AC Transit
 buses, including express buses to 
San Francisco
, and two ferry services-- the 
Alameda-Oakland Ferry
 and the 
Harbor Bay Ferry
.  The island is also close to the 
BART
 train service.

Even though the island is just minutes off 
Interstate 880
, the speed limit on the island is 25 mph (40 km/h) on almost every road.  Many unaware drivers fail to slow down after exiting the highway.  Groups like Pedestrian Friendly Alameda and BikeAlameda advocate stronger enforcement of speeding laws.

Due to its proximity to the Bay, 
wind surfers
 and 
kite surfers
 can often be seen along Crown Memorial State Beach. From the beach you also have views of the 
San Francisco
 skyline and the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
.

One of the recent attractions is the 
aircraft carrier
 
USS 
Hornet
, a 
museum ship
 at the former 
Naval Air Station
. The disused base and the streets of nearby Oakland were used to film the underground city and 
motorcycle
 chase sequences in 
The Matrix Reloaded
 (
2003
). The Posey tube was used, with other Bay Area tunnels, in the filming of the 
1970
 version of 
THX-1138
.

One of Alameda's most famous residents is 
General James Doolittle
 who won the medal of honor for his bombing of Japan during WWII. Alameda is also the hometown of baseball greats 
Willie Stargell
, 
Jimmy Rollins
 and 
Dontrelle Willis
.  Because of its active naval base, many people in naval families, such as 
Tom Hanks
 and 
Jim Morrison
 lived in Alameda briefly during their lives.  The current President of the California State Senate 
Don Perata
 lives in Alameda.

Community power and telecom
[
edit
]

Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power and telecommunications service that delivers services directly to consumers. The telecommunications service has the potential of far exceeding the capabilities of the various cable and DSL providers in the larger region.

There have been proposals by the power producer to produce energy from waste, but not within the city of Alameda. Instead this energy would be produced at a waste transfer station located  in neighboring (and downwind) 
San Leandro
. Owing to the expected release of toxic emissions from what is essentially a 
garbage
 
incinerator
, the mayor and city council of San Leandro rejected the proposal. The mayor vowed to fight this proposal, suggesting that Alameda could instead place this near their municipal golf course.

Also, unlike the three major power producers in California, Alameda is not required to establish 
net metering
 for home 
photovoltaic
 power producers, so the city currently lags far behind other communities in producing truly "green" energy, even though they have a potentially productive site for supplemental wind energy on the western edge of the former naval air station here.
