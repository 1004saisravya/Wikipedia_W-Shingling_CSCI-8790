Nashville, often known asMusic City,[9]is the capital andmost populous cityin the U.S. state ofTennessee. It is theseatofDavidson CountyinMiddle Tennessee, located on theCumberland River.[10]Nashville had a population of 689,447 at the2020 census,[d]making it the21st-most populous city in the United Statesand the fourth-most populous city inthe Southeast.[6]The city is the center of theNashville metropolitan area, home to 2.1 million people, and is among the fastest growing cities in the nation.[11][12]
Named forFrancis Nash, a general of theContinental Armyduring theAmerican Revolutionary War, the city was founded in 1779 when this territory was still considered part of North Carolina. The city grew quickly due to its strategic location as a port on the Cumberland River and, in the 19th century, a railroad center. Nashville as part of Tennessee seceded during theAmerican Civil War; in 1862 it was the first state capital in theConfederacyto be taken byUnion forces. It was occupied through the war. After the war, the city gradually reclaimed its stature. It became a center of trade and developed a manufacturing base.
Since 1963, Nashville has had aconsolidated city-countygovernment, which includes six smaller municipalities in a two-tier system. The city is governed by a mayor, a vice-mayor, and a 40-member metropolitan council. Some 35 of the members are elected fromsingle-member districts, while five are electedat-large. Reflecting the city's position in state government, Nashville is home to theTennessee Supreme Court's courthouse forMiddle Tennessee, one of the state'sthree divisions.
As of 2020, Nashville is considered aglobal city, type "Gamma" by theGaWC.[13]The city is a major center for themusic industry, especiallycountry music. It is home to threemajor professional sports teams: thePredators,Titans, andNashville SC. The city is also the home of many colleges and universities includingTennessee State University,Vanderbilt University,Belmont University,Fisk University,Trevecca Nazarene University, andLipscomb University. Nashville is sometimes referred to as the "Athensof the South" due to the large number of educational institutions.[14]The city is also a major center for the healthcare,[15]publishing,[16]banking,[17]automotive,[18]and technology[19]industries. Entities with headquarters in the city includeAllianceBernstein,[20]Asurion,[21]Bridgestone Americas,[22]Captain D's,[23]Concord,Gideons International,Hospital Corporation of America,[24]LifeWay Christian Resources,[25]Logan's Roadhouse,[26]andRyman Hospitality Properties.[27]


### History


### 18th and 19th centuries
In 1689, French-Canadian traderMartin Chartierestablished a trading post on the Cumberland River, near the present-day site of the city.[28]In 1714, a group of French traders under the command of Charles Charleville established a settlement and trading post at the present location of downtown Nashville, which became known as French Lick. These settlers quickly established an extensive fur trading network with the local Native Americans, but by the 1740s the settlement had largely been abandoned.[29]
In 1779, explorersJames RobertsonandJohn Donelsonled a party ofOvermountain Mento the site of French Lick, and constructedFort Nashborough. It was named forFrancis Nash, theAmerican Revolutionary Warhero. Nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location as a port on theCumberland River, a tributary of theOhio River; and its later status as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved African Americans and 14 free African Americans.[30]In 1806, Nashville wasincorporatedas a city and became thecounty seatofDavidson County, Tennessee. In 1843, the city was named as the permanent capital of the state ofTennessee.  Knoxville, Kingston & Murfreesboro were prior locations of the state capital.[31]
The city government of Nashville owned 24 slaves by 1831, and 60 prior to theCivil War. They were "put to work to build the first successful water system and maintain the streets."[32]Auction blocks and brokers' offices were part of the slave market at the heart of the city.[32]It was the center of plantations cultivating tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, in addition to the breeding and training of thoroughbred horses, and other livestock. For years Nashville was considered one of the wealthiest southern capitals and a large portion of its prominence was from the iron business. Nashville led the south for iron production.[33]
The cholera epidemic that struck Nashville in 1849–1850 took the life of former U.S. PresidentJames K. Polkand resulted in high fatalities. There were 311 deaths from cholera in 1849[34][35]and an estimated 316 to about 500 in 1850.[36]
Before the Civil War, about 700 freeBlackslived in small enclaves in northern Nashville. More than 3,200 enslaved African Americans lived in the city.[37]By 1860, when the firstrumblings of secessionbegan to be heard across theSouth, antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city.
The city's significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region's important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall toU.S.troops, and the state was occupied by the U.S. Army for the duration of the war. Many enslaved African Americans from Middle Tennessee fled as refugees to Union lines; they were housed in contraband camps around military installations in Nashville's eastern, western, and southern borders. TheBattle of Nashville(December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted awar of attrition, makingguerrillaraids and engaging in small skirmishes. Confederate forces in theDeep Southwere almost constantly in retreat.
In 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of theKu Klux Klanwas founded by Confederate veteranJohn W. Morton. He was reported to have initiated GeneralNathan Bedford Forrestinto the white-supremacist organization.[38]The latter became Grand Wizard of the organization, which had chapters of this secret,insurgentgroup forming throughout the state and across the South. They opposed voting and political organizing byfreedmen, tried to control their behavior by threats, violence and murder, and sometimes also attacked their White allies, including schoolteachers from the North and Freedman's Bureau officials.
Whites directed violence against freedmen and their descendants both during and after theReconstruction era. Two freedmen,David JonesandJo Reed, were lynched in Nashville by White mobs in 1872 and 1875, respectively.[39][40]Reed was hanged from a bridge over the river, but survived after the rope broke and he fell into the water. He successfully escaped the city soon thereafter.[41]
In the aftermath of the Civil War, theFisk Jubilee SingersofFisk Universityin Nashville emerged as a beacon of hope and cultural pride. By 1871, this ensemble began touring the U.S. and Europe, earning international acclaim for their performances ofNegro spirituals.[42]Their success not only provided vital funding for their university[43]but also marked Nashville as a significant center for African American music and culture, laying the groundwork for the city's enduring musical legacy.
In 1873, Nashville suffered another cholera epidemic, along with towns throughout Sumner County along railroad routes and the Cumberland River. This was part of a larger epidemic that struck the Mississippi Valley system and other areas of the United States, such as New York and towns along its major lakes and rivers. The epidemic is estimated to have killed around 1,000 people in Nashville,[44]and 50,000 total.
Meanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base. The post–Civil War years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to Nashville and Davidson County. Wealthy planters and businessmen built grand, classical-style buildings. A replica of theParthenonwas constructed inCentennial Park, near downtown.[45]
On April 30, 1892,Ephraim Grizzard, an African-American man, waslynchedin a spectacle murder in front of a white mob of 10,000 in Nashville. He was a suspect in the assault of two white sisters.[46]His lynching was described by journalistIda B. Wellsas: "A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the nineteenth century civilization of the Athens of the South."[47]His brother, Henry Grizzard, had been lynched and hanged on April 24, 1892, in nearby Goodlettsville as a suspect in the same assault incident. From 1877 to 1950, a total of six lynchings of Blacks were conducted in Davidson County, four before the turn of the century.[48]


### Earlier 20th century
By the turn of the century Nashville was home to numerous organizations and individuals associated with revisionistLost Cause of the Confederacypseudohistory, and it has been referred to as the "cradle of the Lost Cause".[49]In 1893, the magazineConfederate Veteranbegan publication in the city.[50]In 1894, the first chapter ofUnited Daughters of the Confederacywas founded in the city, and it hosted the first two conventions of the organization.[51]Prominent proponents of the mythology, the so-called "guardians of the Lost Cause", were concentrated Downtown and in the West End, nearCentennial Park.[49]
At the same time,Jefferson Streetbecame the historic center of the African American community, with similar districts developing in the Black neighborhoods in East and North Nashville. In 1912, theTennessee Agricultural and Industrial and Normal Schoolwas moved to Jefferson Street.[37]The firstPrince's Hot Chicken Shackoriginated at the corner of Jefferson Street and 28th Avenue in 1945.[37]Jefferson Street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians,[37]and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction ofInterstate 40in the late 1960s.[52]
In 1925, the establishment of theGrand Ole Oprymarked the beginning of Nashville's journey as the 'Country Music Capital of the World',[53]drawing musicians and fans alike to the city and setting the stage for its future as a country music powerhouse.[54]
In 1950, the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members fromsingle-member districts, rather thanat-largevoting. This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had Black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African American attorneysZ. Alexander Loobyand Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.[55]
During the mid-1950s, Nashville underwent a musical transformation with the emergence of the 'Nashville Sound,' which was characterized by "smooth strings and choruses", "sophisticated background vocals" and "smooth tempos" associated withtraditional pop.[56][57]The new sound broadened country music's appeal and solidified Nashville's status as a music recording and production center.
With the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with "all deliberate speed", the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-White East High School to him. A similar case was filed byReverendHenry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the "Nashville Plan", where the city's public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.[37]
Urban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.[37]


### Postwar development to end of 20th century
Rapid suburbanization occurred during the years immediately afterWorld War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County JudgeBeverly Brileyand MayorBen West.[58]
Following the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided.[58]This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.
In the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms. Hotels and restaurants were also segregated. Between February 13 and May 10, 1960,a series of sit-inswere organized at lunch counters in downtown Nashville by theNashville Student Movementand Nashville Christian Leadership Council, and were part of a broadersit-in movementin the southeastern United States as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities.[59]On April 19, 1960, the house ofZ. Alexander Looby, an African American attorney and council member, was bombed by segregationists.[60]Protesters marched to the city hall the next day. Mayor Ben West said he supported the desegregation of lunch counters, which civil rights activists had called for.[61]
In 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson County, forming ametropolitan government. The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are electedat-largeand 35 are elected fromsingle-member districts, each to serve a term of four years.[58]
As Nashville evolved in the 1960s, its music scene diversified, welcomingrock,pop, and other genres and the 'Nashville Sound' transformed into 'Countrypolitan'. Artists likeBob DylanandJohnny Cashcame to Nashville to record, reflecting the city's expanding influence in the music industry.[62][63]In 1960,Timereported that Nashville had "nosed outHollywoodas the nation's second biggest (afterNew York) record-producing center."[64]
In 1957 Nashville desegregated its school system using an innovative grade a year plan, in response to a class action suitKelly vs. Board of Education of Nashville. By 1966 the Metro Council abandoned the grade a year plan and completely desegregated the entire school system at one time.[65]
Congress passed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, but tensions continued as society was slow to change. On April 8, 1967, a riot broke out on the college campuses of Fisk University and Tennessee State University,historically Black colleges, afterStokely Carmichaelspoke aboutBlack PoweratVanderbilt University.[66]Although it was viewed as a "race riot", it had classist characteristics.[66]
In 1979, theKu Klux Klanburnt crosses outside two African American sites in Nashville, including the city headquarters of theNAACP.[67]
Historically, Nashvillezoningpermitted the construction ofduplexhousing. In the 1980s and 1990s, Nashville lawmakers downzoned sections of Nashville to exclusively permitsingle-family housing. Proponents of these downzonings said they would raise home values.[68][69][70]
Since the 1970s, the city and county have undergone tremendous growth, particularly during theeconomic boomof the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-Tennessee Governor,Phil Bredesen. Making urban renewal a priority, Bredesen fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including theCountry Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the downtownNashville Public Library, theBridgestone Arena, andNissan Stadium.[71][72]
Nissan Stadium (formerly Adelphia Coliseum and LP Field) was built after theNational Football League's (NFL)Houston Oilersagreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL team debuted in Nashville in 1998 atVanderbilt Stadium, and Nissan Stadium opened in the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to theTennessee Titansand finished the season with theMusic City Miracleand a closeSuper Bowlgame.[73]TheSt. Louis Ramswon in thelast playof the game.[74]
In 1997, Nashville was awarded aNational Hockey Leagueexpansion team; this was named theNashville Predators.[75]Since the 2003–04 season, the Predators have made the playoffs in all but four seasons. In 2017, they made theStanley Cup Finalsfor the first time in franchise history, but ultimately fell to thePittsburgh Penguins, 4games to 2, in the best-of-seven series.[76]


### 21st century
On January 22, 2009, residents rejectedNashville Charter Amendment 1, which sought to make English the official language of the city.[77]
Between May 1 and 7, 2010, much of Nashville wasextensively flooded as part of a series of 1,000 year floodsthroughout Middle and West Tennessee. Much of the flooding took place in areas along the Cumberland andHarpethRivers andMill Creek, and caused extensive damage to the many buildings and structures in the city, including theGrand Ole Opry House,Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center,Opry Mills Mall,Schermerhorn Symphony Center,Bridgestone Arena, andNissan Stadium. Sections of Interstate 24 and Briley Parkway were also flooded. Eleven people died in the Nashville area as a result of the flooding, and damages were estimated to be over $2 billion.[78]
The city recovered after theGreat Recession.[79]In March 2012, a Gallup poll ranked Nashville in the top five regions for job growth.[80]In 2013, Nashville was described as "Nowville" and "It City" byGQ,Forbes, andThe New York Times.[81][82][83]
Nashville elected its first female mayor,Megan Barry, on September 25, 2015.[84]As a council member, Barry had officiated at the city's first same-sex wedding on June 26, 2015.[85]
In 2017, Nashville's economy was deemed the third fastest-growing in the nation,[86]and the city was named the "hottest housing market in the US" by Freddie Mac realtors.[87]In May 2017, census estimates showed Nashville had passedMemphisto become most populated city in Tennessee.[88]Nashville has also made national headlines for its "homelessness crisis". Rising housing prices and the opioid crisis have resulted in more people being out on the streets: as of 2018[update], between 2,300 and 20,000 Nashvillians are homeless.[89]
On March 6, 2018, due to felony charges filed against Mayor Barry relating to the misuse of public funds, she resigned before the end of her term. Aspecial electionwas called. Following a ruling by theTennessee Supreme Court, the Davidson County Election Commission set the special election for May 24, 2018, to meet the requirement of 75 to 80 days from the date of resignation.[90]David Briley, who was Vice Mayor during the Barry administration and Acting Mayor after her resignation, won the special election with just over 54% of the vote,[91]becoming the 70th mayor of Nashville.[92]
On May 1, 2018, voters rejectedLet's Move Nashville, a referendum which would have funded construction of an $8.9 billion mass transit system under the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (nowWeGo Public Transit) by a 2 to 1 margin.[93]
On September 28, 2019,John Cooperbecame the ninth mayor of Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.[94]
Between 2010 and 2020, the city experienced significant growth in population and demand.  For example, the median home price in North Nashville increased from $100,710 in 2010 to $532,121 in 2020. During this period, four census tracts in the city transitioned from majority Black to majority non-Black. By 2020, 99% of Nashville's neighborhoods were considered unaffordable for Black and Hispanic families earning median incomes.[95][96]
On March 3, 2020,a tornadotracked west to east, just north of the downtown Nashville area, killing at least 25 people and leaving tens of thousands without electricity.  Neighborhoods impacted included North Nashville, Germantown, East Nashville, Donelson, and Hermitage.[97]
On December 25, 2020,a vehicle exploded on Second Avenue, killing the perpetrator and injuring eight others.[98]
On March 27, 2023,a gunman killed three children and three staffat the Covenant School, before being fatally gunned down by police.[99]
OnDecember 9, 2023, tornadoes caused considerable destruction and left three people dead.[100]


### Geography


### Topography
Nashville lies on theCumberland Riverin the northwestern portion of theNashville Basin. Nashville's elevation ranges from its lowest point, 385 feet (117 m)above sea levelat the Cumberland River,[101]to its highest point, 1,163 feet (354 m) above sea level in theRadnor Lake State Natural Area.[102][103]Nashville also sits at the start of theHighland Rim, a geophysical region of very hilly land. Because of this, Nashville is very hilly. Nashville also has some stand alone hills around the city such as the hill on which theTennessee State Capitolbuilding sits.
The higher elevations of the Highland Rim encircle the Nashville Basin with the Eastern and Western Highland Rim[104]portions being the largest expanses. Part of the Western Highland Rim slopes down and wraps the hills along the western flanks of the city in a contiguous forest thought to be one of the largest of such forest habitats in Middle Tennessee. Nashville's Highland Rim Forest connects Beaman Park, Bells Bend Park, Warner Parks, and Radnor Lake State Park.[105]
According to theUnited States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 527.9 square miles (1,367 km2), of which 504.0 square miles (1,305 km2) of it is land and 23.9 square miles (62 km2) of it (4.53%) is water.


### Cityscape
Nashville's downtown area features a diverse assortment of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural attractions. The Broadway and 2nd Avenue areas feature entertainment venues, bars, night clubs, retail, and an assortment of restaurants. North of Broadway lie Nashville's central business district, Legislative Plaza, Capitol Hill and theTennessee Bicentennial Mall. Cultural and architectural attractions can be found throughout the city.
Three major interstate highways (I-40, I-65 and I-24) converge near the core area of downtown, and many regional cities are within a day's driving distance.
Nashville's first skyscraper, theLife & Casualty Tower, was completed in 1957 and launched the construction of other high rises in downtown Nashville. After the construction of theAT&T Building(commonly referred to by locals as the "Batman Building") in 1994, the downtown area saw little construction until the mid-2000s.The Pinnacle, a high rise office building which opened in 2010, was the first skyscraper in Nashville to be built in the preceding 15 years.[106]
Since 2000, Nashville has seen two urban construction booms (one prior to the Great Recession and the other after) that have yielded multiple high-rises (defined by Emporis as buildings of a minimum of 115 feet tall). Of the city's 33 towers of 300 feet tall or taller (as of April 2023), 24 have been completed since 2000. Of note, Nashville has a disproportionate number of buildings 300 feet and taller in relation to its overall metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population of about 2 million (2021 U.S. Census Bureau estimate). This is due, in part, to the tourism-centric city's multiple hotel towers and to many condominium towers having multiple unit owners who also own other residential properties in both Nashville and in other markets. In contrast, and for comparison, Phoenix, with an MSA population of about 4.95 million (2021 estimate) offered 21 buildings of 300 feet and taller (as of late 2024).
Many civic and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently completed. A new MTA bus hub was recently completed in downtown Nashville, as was the Music City Star (now known as theWeGo Star) pilot project. Several public parks have been constructed, such as the Public Square. Riverfront Park is scheduled to be extensively updated. TheMusic City Centeropened in May 2013.[107]It is a 1,200,000-square-foot (110,000 m2) convention center with 350,000 square feet (33,000 m2) of exhibit space.[108]


### Neighborhoods


### Flora
Nashville, with 56% of the ground surface within its city limits covered in urban tree canopy, has the largest percentage of forested area of any city in the U.S. With Nashville's 320,000 total acres, this translates into over 170,000 wooded acres that may earn it the largest urban tree canopy by area, as well.[109]The nearby city ofLebanonis notable and even named for its so-called "cedar glades", which occur on soils too poor to support most trees and are instead dominated byVirginian juniper.Blackberrybushes,Virginia pine,loblolly pine,sassafras,red maple,river birch,American beech,river cane,mountain laurelandsycamoreare all common native trees, along with many others.[110]
In addition to the native forests, the combination of hot summers, abundant rainfall and mild winters permit a wide variety of both temperate and subtropical plants to be cultivated easily.Southern magnoliaand cherry blossom trees are commonly cultivated here, with the city having an annual cherry blossom festival.[111]Crepe myrtlesandyewbushes are also commonly grown throughout Metro Nashville, and the winters are mild enough thatsweetbay magnoliais evergreen whenever it is cultivated. Thepansyflower is popular to plant during the autumn, and some varieties will flower overwinter in Nashville's subtropical climate. However, many hot-weather plants likepetuniaand evenpapyrusthrive as annuals, andJapanese bananawill die aboveground during winter but re-sprout after the danger of frost is over. Unbeknownst to most Tennesseans, evencold-hardy palms, particularlyneedle palmanddwarf palmetto, are grown uncommonly but often successfully, while the tallerwindmill palmis more marginal, perishing below about 5 °F (−15 °C) without protection. High desert plants likeColorado spruceandprickly pear cactusare also grown somewhat commonly, as areYucca filamentosaand the trunkingYucca rostrata.


### Climate
Nashville International Airportin Donelson has ahumid subtropical climate(KöppenCfa,TrewarthaCf),[112]with hot, humid summers and generally cool winters typical of theUpper South.[113][114][115]
Snowfall occurs during the winter months, but it is usually not heavy. Average annual snowfall is about 4.7 inches (12 cm), falling mostly in January and February and occasionally in March, November and December.[116]The largest snow event since 2003 was on January 22, 2016, when Nashville received 8 inches (20 cm) of snow in a single storm; the largest overall was 17 inches (43 cm), received on March 17, 1892, during theSt. Patrick's Day Snowstorm.[117]
Rainfall is typically greater in solar spring (Feb-Apr) and summer (May-Jul), while the solar autumn months (Aug-Oct) are the driest on average. Spring and fall are prone tosevere thunderstorms, which may bringtornadoes, largehail, flash floods and damaging wind, with recent major events onApril 16, 1998;April 7, 2006;February 5, 2008;April 10, 2009;May 1–2, 2010; andMarch 3, 2020. Relative humidity in Nashville averages 83% in the mornings and 60% in the afternoons,[118]which is considered moderate for the Southeastern United States.[119]In recent decades, due to urban development, Nashville has developed anurban heat island; especially on cool, clear nights, temperatures are up to 10 °F (5.6 °C) warmer in the heart of the city than in rural outlying areas. The Nashville region lies within USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a.[120]From 1970 to 2020 the average summer temperature has risen 2.8 degrees F (1.5 C).[121]
Nashville's long springs and autumns combined with a diverse array of trees and grasses can often make it uncomfortable forallergysufferers.[122]In 2008, Nashville was ranked as the 26th-worst spring allergy city in the U.S. by theAsthma and Allergy Foundation of America.[123]
The coldest temperature ever officially recorded in Nashville was −17 °F (−27 °C) onJanuary 21, 1985, and the hottest was 109 °F (43 °C) onJune 29, 2012.[124]Nashville allegedly had a low of −18 °F (−28 °C) on January 26, 1832, but this was decades before record-keeping began and isn't counted as the official record low.[125]
The mean annual temperature at Nashville International Airport is 60.8 °F (16.0 °C). Monthly averages range from 39.6 °F (4.2 °C) in January to 80.7 °F (27.1 °C) in July, with adiurnal temperature variationof 18.9 to 23.7 °F (10.5 to 13.2 °C). Diurnal temperature variation is highest in April and lowest in December, but it is also relatively high in October and relatively low in January. Donelson's climate classifications areKöppenCfaandTrewarthaCfakthanks to its hot summers (average over 71.6 °F (22.0 °C)), cool winters (average over 32.0 °F (0.0 °C)) and long (8+ months) growing seasons (average over 50.0 °F (10.0 °C)). Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but there is still slight variation. The wet season runs from February through July, reaching its zenith in May with 128 mm of rain. The dry season runs from August through January with an October nadir of 85 mm and secondary December peak of 113 mm.
The mean annual temperature at Old Hickory Dam is 58.5 °F (14.7 °C). Monthly averages range from 37.1 °F (2.8 °C) in January to 78.6 °F (25.9 °C) in August, with adiurnal temperature variationof 19.8 to 26.3 °F (11.0 to 14.6 °C). Diurnal temperature variation is highest in April and lowest in January. Old Hickory's climate classifications areKöppenCfaandTrewarthaDoakthanks to its hot summers (average over 71.6 °F (22.0 °C)), cool winters (average over 32.0 °F (0.0 °C)) and mediocre (4–7 months) growing seasons (average over 50.0 °F (10.0 °C)). Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but there is still slight variation. The wet season runs from February through July, reaching its zenith in April with 120 mm of rain. The dry season runs from August through January with an October/November nadir of 85 mm and secondary December peak of 113 mm.

### Law and government
The city of Nashville and Davidson County merged in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems ofurban sprawl. The combined entity is officially known as "the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County", and is popularly known as "Metro Nashville" or simply "Metro". It offers services such aspolice,fire,electricity, water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was split into two service districts—the "urban services district" and the "general services district". The urban services district encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately 72 square miles (190 km2),[254]and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County. There are six smaller municipalities within the consolidated city-county:Belle Meade,Berry Hill,Forest Hills,Oak Hill,Goodlettsville(partially), andRidgetop(partially). These municipalities use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing most other services. Previously, the city ofLakewoodalso had a separate charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes passing.[255]

### Politics
Nashville has been aDemocraticstronghold since at least the end ofReconstruction, and has remained staunchly Democratic even as the state as a whole has trended stronglyRepublican. Pockets of Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided after the 1990s.[258]While local elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all the city's elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. The city is split among 10 state house districts, all of which are held by Democrats. Three state senate districts and part of a fourth are within the county; three are held by Democrats and one by a Republican.[259]
In the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve as leaders of both theSenateandHouseDemocratic Caucuses. Representative Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. SenatorJeff Yarbroserves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus.
Democrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have failed to carry Davidson County only five times since Reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988.[260]In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections, as the state capitol has continued to trend more Democratic even as most of the rest of the state has become staunchly Republican. In the2000 presidential election, Tennessean DemocratAl Gorecarried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state and thus the presidency. In the2004 election, DemocratJohn Kerrycarried Nashville with 55% of the vote whileGeorge W. Bushwon the state by 14 points. In2008,Barack Obamacarried Nashville with 60% of the vote while RepublicanJohn McCainwon Tennessee by 15 points.
Nashville was in a single congressional district, the5th, for most of its history. A Republican had not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874, until 2023 when the GOP-controlled state legislature controversially split Nashville into parts of the 5th,6th, and 7th districts in a partisangerrymanderan additional Republican to Tennessee's congressional delegation as part of the2022 redistricting cycle.[261]This Republican gerrymander 'cracked' the Democratic stronghold of Nashville across three otherwise Republican districts, ensuring three Republican representatives. This gerrymander 'diminished the influence of Black voters and other voters of color concentrated in Nashville', by splitting them up and adding portions of the Nashville community into districts that are overwhelmingly white and Republican, thus diluting the voting power of Black voters in the state.[262]
Prior to this gerrymander, Republicans made a few spirited challenges to the 5th district in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, almost winning the district in 1968. The last serious bid for the district while still a Democratic stronghold was in 1972, when the Republican candidate gained 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probablyJo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and wasSpeaker of the Housefor much ofFranklin Roosevelt's first term as president. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville wasPercy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and wasHouse Majority Whipfrom 1949 to 1953. Former mayorsRichard FultonandBill Boneralso sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.
From 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the7th District, represented by RepublicanMarsha Blackburn. This area was roughly coextensive with the portion of Nashville she had represented in the state senate from 1998 to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census.

Nashville is centrally located at the crossroads of threeInterstate Highways,I-40(east-west),I-24(northwest-southeast) andI-65(north-south). I-40 connects the city betweenMemphisto the west andKnoxvilleto the east, I-24 connects betweenClarksvilleto the northwest andChattanoogato the southeast, and I-65 connects betweenLouisvilleto the north andHuntsvilleto the south. All three of these interstate highways, which also serve the suburbs, form briefconcurrencieswith each other in the city, and completely encircle downtown.I-440is a bypass route connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of Downtown Nashville.Briley Parkway, the majority of which is afreeway, forms a bypass around the north side of the city and its interstates. Ellington Parkway, a freeway made up of a section ofUS 31E, runs between east of downtown and Briley Parkway, serving as an alternative route to I-65.I-840provides an outer southern bypass for the city and its suburbs.U.S. Routes31, 31E,31W,31 Alternate,41,41 Alternate,70,70S, and431also serve Nashville, intersecting in the city's center as arterial surface roads and radiating outward. Most of these routes are called "pikes" and many carry the names of nearby towns to which they lead. Among these are Clarksville Pike, Gallatin Pike, Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Nolensville Pike, and Franklin Pike.[278]
WeGo Public Transitprovides bus transit within the city. Routes utilize ahub and spokemethod, centered around the Music City Central transit station in downtown.[279]A rejectedexpansion planincluded use ofbus rapid transitandlight railservice at some point in the future.[280]Asubsequent expansion planfocused on improving sidewalks, adding smart signals, upgrading bus stops and transit centers, implementing a 24-hour bus service and adding 54 miles of high-capacity transit corridors was passed in 2024.[281]

Although a major freight hub forCSX Transportation, Nashville is not currently served byAmtrak, thethird-largest metropolitan areain the U.S. to have this distinction.[285]Nashville'sUnion Stationhad once been a major intercity passenger rail center for theLouisville and Nashville Railroad;Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway; and theTennessee Central Railway, reaching Midwestern cities and cities on the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. However, by the time of Amtrak's founding, service had been cut back to a single train, theFloridian, which ran fromChicagotoMiamiandSt. Petersburg, Florida. It served Union Station until its cancellation on October 9, 1979, due to poor track conditions resulting in late trains and low ridership, ending over 120 years of intercity rail service in Nashville.
While there have been few proposals to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, there have been repeated calls from residents.[286]In addition to scarce federal funding, Tennessee state officials do not believe that Nashville is large enough to support intercity rail. "It would be wonderful to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service," said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation.[286]Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state.[286]However, in 2020, Amtrak indicated it was consideringa service that would run from Atlanta to Nashville by way of Chattanooga.[287]
Nashville launched a passenger commuter rail system called the Music City Star (now theWeGo Star) on September 18, 2006.
