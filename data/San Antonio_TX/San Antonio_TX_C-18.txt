The city was named in 1691 by a Spanish expedition in honor of SaintAnthony of Padua. It was part of theSpanish Empire, then theMexican Republicfrom 1821 to 1836, before joining the United States.[14][15][16]Straddling the regional divide betweenSouthandCentral Texas, San Antonio anchors the southwestern corner of an urbanmegaregioncolloquially known as theTexas Triangle. It lies about 80 miles (130 km) fromAustinalong theI-35corridor, and together theSan Antonio–Austin metroplexis home to approximately 5 million people.[17]

### History
At the time of European encounter, thePayaya peoplelived near theSan Antonio River Valleyin theSan Pedro Springsarea. They called the vicinityYanaguana, meaning "refreshing waters". In 1691, a group of Spanish explorers andmissionariescame upon the river and Payaya settlement on June 13, the feast day ofSt. Anthony of Padua.[20]They named the place and river "San Antonio" in his honor.[21]
It was years before any Spanish settlement took place.Father Antonio de Olivaresvisited the site in 1709, and he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there. The viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716, as he wanted to forestall any French expansion into the area from their colony ofLa Louisianeto the east, as well as prevent illegal trading with the Payaya. He directedMartín de Alarcón, the governor ofCoahuila y Tejas, to establish the mission complex. Differences between Alarcón and Olivares resulted in delays, and construction did not start until 1718.[22]Olivares built, with the help of thePayayaand thePastia people, theMisión de San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo), thePresidio San Antonio de Bexar, the bridge that connected both, and theAcequia Madre de Valero.[5]
The families who clustered around the presidio and mission were the start of Villa de Béjar, destined to become the most important town inSpanish Texas.[23]On May 1, the governor transferred ownership of the Mission San Antonio de Valero (later famous as The Alamo) to Fray Antonio de Olivares.[5]On May 5, 1718, he commissioned the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar ("Béjar" in modern Spanish orthography) on the west side of the San Antonio River, one-fourth league from the mission.[22]
On February 14, 1719, the Marquis ofSan Miguel de Aguayoproposed to the king of Spain that 400 families be transported from theCanary Islands,Galicia, orHavanato populate the province of Texas. His plan was approved, and notice was given theCanary Islanders(isleños) to furnish 200 families; theCouncil of the Indiessuggested that 400 families should be sent from the Canaries to Texas by way of Havana andVeracruz. By June 1730, 25 families had reachedCuba, and 10 families had been sent to Veracruz before orders from Spain came to stop the re-settlement.[24]
Under the leadership ofJuan Leal Goraz, the group marched overland from Veracruz to the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731. Due to marriages along the way, the party now included 15 families, a total of 56 persons. They joined the military community established in 1718. The immigrants formed the nucleus of the villa of San Fernando de Béxar, the first regularly organized civil government in Texas. Several older families of San Antonio trace their descent from the Canary Island colonists. María Rosa Padrón was the first baby born of Canary Islander descent in San Antonio.[24]
During the Spanish–Mexican settlement of Southwestern lands, which took place over the following century, Juan Leal Goraz Jr. was a prominent figure. He claimed nearly 100,000 sq miles (153,766 acres) as Spanish territory and held some control for nearly three decades; this area stretched across six present-day states. San Antonio was designated as Leal Goraz's capital. It represented Mexican expansion into the area. With his robust military forces, he led exploration and establishing Spanish colonial bases as far asSan Francisco, California. Widespread bankruptcy forced Leal Goraz Jr.'s army back into the current boundaries of Mexico; they fell into internal conflict and turmoil with neighboring entities.
San Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas; it was designated as the capital of the Spanish, laterMexican, province of Tejas. From San Antonio, theCamino Real(today Nacogdoches Road), was built to the small frontier town ofNacogdoches. Mexico allowedEuropean Americansettlers from the United States into the territory; they mostly occupied land in the eastern part. In 1835, whenAntonio López de Santa Annaunilaterally abolished theMexican Constitution of 1824, violence ensued in manystates of Mexico. which led to many short-lived independent republics.[25]This, in addition to Mexico's abolition of slavery, and cultural differences between the Texians and the Mexicans, led to theTexas Revolution.[26][27]
In a series of battles, theTexian Army, which was made up primarily of American citizens, succeeded in forcing Mexican soldiers out of the settlement areas east of San Antonio. Under the leadership ofBen Milam, in theBattle of Bexar, December 1835,Texianforces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by GeneralMartin Perfecto de Cos, Santa Anna's brother-in-law. In the spring of 1836, Santa Anna marched on San Antonio. A volunteer force under the command ofJames C. Neilloccupied and fortified the deserted Alamo mission.[28]
Upon his departure, the joint command ofWilliam Barrett TravisandJames Bowiewere left in charge of defending the old mission. TheBattle of the Alamotook place from February 23 to March 6, 1836. The outnumbered Texian force was ultimately defeated, with all of the Alamo defenders killed. These men were seen as "martyrs" for the cause of Texas freedom and "Remember the Alamo" became a rallying cry in the Texian Army's eventual success at defeating Santa Anna's army.[28]
Juan Seguín, who organized the company ofTejanopatriots, who fought for Texas independence, fought at theBattle of Concepción, theSiege of Bexar, and theBattle of San Jacinto, and served as mayor of San Antonio. He was forced out of office due to threats on his life by sectarian newcomers and political opponents in 1842, becoming the last Tejano mayor for nearly 150 years.[29]
In 1845, the United States finally decided to annex Texas and include it as a state in the Union. This led to theMexican–American War. Though the U.S. ultimately won, the war was devastating to San Antonio. By its end, the population of the city had been reduced by almost two-thirds, to 800 inhabitants.[30]Bolstered by migrants and immigrants, by 1860 at the start of theAmerican Civil War, San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people.
In the 1850s,Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who designedCentral Parkin New York City, traveled throughout the Southern andSouthwestU.S., and published accounts of his observations. In his 1859 book about Texas, Olmsted described San Antonio as having a "jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings", which gave it a quality that onlyNew Orleanscould rival in what he described as "odd and antiquated foreignness."[31][32]Following the Civil War, San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle industry. During this period, it remained a frontier city, with a mixture of cultures that was different from other U.S. cities.
German immigrants founded smaller surrounding towns such asNew Braunfels,Castroville,Boerne,Comfort,Fredericksburg, andBulverde, all towns far out from San Antonio. However, the Germans were then drawn to San Antonio for work, and many buildings and streets still bear German names such as Wurzbach, Huebner, and Jones Maltsberger, and Wiederstein. The German impact on San Antonio was great, in the early 1900s it is estimated that at least 1/3 of San Antonio was ethnically German. Many descendants of German immigrants in San Antonio spokeTexas Germanup to the fifth or sixth generations. Texas German is a dialect of German that evolved when the German language was separated from Germany. Texas German is best described as an anglicized-German dialect with a Texas twang. Many older generations in New Braunfels and Fredericksburg still speak Texas German to this day.[33]
In 1877, following theReconstruction Era, theGalveston, Harrisburg, & San Antonio Railroadbecame the firstrailroadto reach San Antonio, connecting it to major markets and port cities.[34]Texas was the first state to have major cities develop by railroads rather than waterways.[35]In Texas, the railroads supported a markedly different pattern of development of major interior cities, such as San Antonio,DallasandFort Worth, compared to the historical development of coastal port cities in the established eastern states.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the streets of the city's downtown were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic. At that time, many of the older historic buildings were demolished in the process of this modernization.[36]
Since the late twentieth century, San Antonio has had steadypopulation growth. The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 census to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005, through both population growth and land annexation (the latter has considerably enlarged the physical area of the city).[37]In 1990, theUnited States Census Bureaureported San Antonio's population as 55.6% Hispanic or Latino, 7.0% Black or African American, and 36.2% non-Hispanic white.[38]
The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park and The Alamo becameUNESCOWorld Heritage sites in 2015 and the city was designated a UNESCO "City of Creativity for Gastronomy" in 2017, one of only 26gastronomycreative cities in the world.[18]
With the increase in professional jobs, San Antonio has become a destination for many college-educated persons, most recently including African Americans in areverse Great Migrationfrom northern and western areas.[39][40]
Over 31,000 migrants who requested asylum have been released by the Border Patrol into the city in 2019 during theNational Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States.[41]

### Politics


### Growth policy
Unlike most large cities in the U.S., San Antonio is not completely surrounded by independent suburban cities, and under Texas state law it exercisesextraterritorial jurisdiction(ETJ) over much of the surroundingunincorporatedland,[182][183]including planning major thoroughfares and enforcing rules for platting and subdivision. It pursues an aggressive annexation policy and opposes the creation of other municipalities within its ETJ.[184]Nearly three-fourths of its land area has been annexed since 1960.[185]
In the 2000s the city annexed several long narrow corridors along major thoroughfares in outlying areas to facilitate eventual annexation of growth developing along the routes. The city planned to annex nearly 40 additional square miles by 2009.[186]
In May 2010, the City of San Antonio agreed to release thousands of acres of land in its extraterritorial jurisdiction along Interstate 10 toSchertz. The agreement releases a total of 3,486 acres (14.11 km2) of San Antonio's ETJ lands north of I-10 to Schertz. The ETJ lands are in an area bordered by FM 1518 to the west, Lower Seguin Road to the north, Cibolo Creek to the east and I-10 to the south.[187]
Involuntary annexation is a controversial issue in those parts of unincorporated Bexar County affected by it. Residents attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values often see annexation as a mechanism to increaseproperty taxrates (which are primarily driven by school district taxes, not city taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy as essential to its overall prosperity.[188]
Since the city has annexed areas over time, San Antonio surrounds several independentenclave cities, includingAlamo Heights,Balcones Heights,Castle Hills,Hill Country Village,Hollywood Park,Kirby,Leon Valley,Olmos Park,Shavano Park, andTerrell Hills.

### Radio
About 50 radio stations can be heard in the San Antonio area; 30 of them are in the city proper. San Antonio is home toiHeartMedia, the largest operator of radio stations in the U.S. Its flagship,WOAI AM-1200, is known for its local news operation, considered among the best in the country. It is a 50,000-watt clear channel station that reaches most of North America at night. The first radio station to broadcast in South Texas wasKTSA AM-550in 1922.
The region'sNational Public Radiomember isTexas Public Radio,[202]a group of three stations; KSTX 89.1 FM is NPR news/talk, KPAC 88.3 is a 24-hour classical music station, and KTXI 90.1 is a mix of NPR news/talk and classical music broadcast for the West Central Texas Hill Country. KSTX also broadcasts "Riverwalk Jazz", featuring Jim Cullum Jazz Band at The Landing, a fixture on the River Walk since 1963.
KRTU 91.7 is a non-commercial radio station based at Trinity University.[203]Unlike most other college radio stations in the U.S., the station plays jazz 17 hours a day and college rock/indie rock at night. College alternative station KSYM, 90.1 FM, is owned by the Alamo Community College District and operated by San Antonio College students; like KRTU, it plays the Third Coast music network during the day and alternative music at night.
Most Latin American stations in the area playregional Mexican,Tejanoor contemporary pop. On January 12, 2006,Univision-ownedKMYO-FM"La Kalle 95.1" changed its format from Hispanic-Rhythmic Contemporary Hits to Spanish Oldies, then named "Recuerdo 95.1". On November 10, 2006,Univisionflipped KLTO Tejano 97.7's format toreggaetonin an attempt to reintroduce the format to San Antonio. Then 97.7 was flipped again to feature a rock format. The station no longer broadcasts anything in English. While still owned by Univision, it broadcast music by artists such asLinkin Park, before being sold to theEducational Media Foundationand flipping once again toAir1.
95.1 was then flipped back to the "La Kalle" format again after being flipped to feature a "95X" format. KLTO was acquired and is operated as a simulcast ofKVBH-FMVibe 107.5. San Antonio radio is diversified, due to an influx of non-TejanoLatinos, mostly from theEast Coast, who serve in the city's various military bases, as well as immigrants from Mexico. Therefore, just like in the rest of the country, radio station conglomerates have been changing formats in San Antonio to reflect shiftingdemographics.


### Television
Despite the relatively large size of both the city proper and the metropolitan area, San Antonio has always been a medium-sized market.
