Los Alamos
 (
Template:Lang-es
, meaning 
The Cottonwoods
) is a 
census-designated place
 in 
Los Alamos County
, 
New Mexico
, United States, that is recognized as one of the development and creation places of the 
atomic bomb
—the primary objective of the 
Manhattan Project
 by 
Los Alamos National Laboratory
 during 
World War II
. The town is located on four 
mesas
 of the 
Pajarito Plateau
, and had a population of about 19,200 as of 2022.
[

 It is the 
county seat
 and one of two population centers in the county known as 
census-designated places
 (CDPs); the other is 
White Rock
.





Toponym
[
edit
]


Los Alamos
 is a 
Spanish
 place name that typically refers to poplar or 
cottonwood trees
. Alternatively, 
Los Alamos
 could refer to the large groves of 
aspen trees
 (
alamo temblon
) that intersperse the coniferous forest on the mountainsides above the townsite, where they are distinctly visible during the autumn months due to their spectacular 
autumn colors
.

History
[
edit
]


The entrance to Los Alamos was guarded at the Main Gate during the Manhattan Project.


The ruins of permanent 
Puebloan
 settlements, such as those located in nearby 
Bandelier National Monument
 and 
Tsankawi
, and numerous other sites such as 
cliff dwellings
 indicate that the area has been inhabited during various eras since around 1150 AD. The first settlers on the plateau are thought to be 
Keres
 speaking Native Americans around the 10th century. Around 1300, 
Tewa
 settlers immigrated from the Four Corners Region and built large cities but were driven out within 50 years by 
Navajo
 and 
Apache
 raids and by drought.

In the late 19th century, 
homesteaders
 utilized the land for ranching. Most homesteaders built simple log cabins that they only lived in during warm weather to feed livestock. Many of the homesteaders later moved down to the warmer 
Rio Grande
 Valley. In 1917, homesteader Harold H. Brook sold part of his land and buildings to Ashley Pond II, a businessman from Detroit who founded the 
Los Alamos Ranch School
. The area was used to teach young men basic ranching and other outdoor survival skills.

In 1943, during 
World War II
, the 
United States Department of War
 exercised 
eminent domain
 over the Ranch School and all remaining homesteads in the area so that the relatively isolated location could be used for the secretive 
Manhattan Project
, which ultimately developed the world's first nuclear weapons.
[
6
]
 Facilities for research and development were quickly built and scientists and engineers from all over the world were assigned to the project; however, all information about the town and project was held secret from the public. Los Alamos was referred to under the code name "
Site Y
" by military personnel, and was known only as "The Hill" by many in nearby Santa Fe. 

Los Alamos was originally built as a 
closed city
 accessible from the outside world through only two gates.
[
7
]
  The specific location of the project was a tightly guarded secret.  All employees recruited to work at the Los Alamos site were given a memorandum instructing them to travel to Santa Fe and report to the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
 office at 109 East Palace Avenue.
[
8
]
  At that location, 
Dorothy McKibbin
 provided newcomers with the necessary documentation to get through security checkpoints (initially, letters signed by 
J. Robert Oppenheimer
 himself, and later, security passes), along with specific directions to the Hill.
[
9
]
  The project was further concealed by designating its mailing address as 
PO Box
 1663, Santa Fe, N.M.
[
10
]
 All incoming truckloads were falsely labeled as common items in order to conceal the true nature of their contents, and any outbound correspondence by those working and living in Los Alamos was censored by military officials. 

Not until after the 
bombing of Hiroshima
 was information about the 
Manhattan Project
 released to the public; being announced by the White House at 11 am on 6 August (when 
Nichols
 was able to tell his wife what he had been doing). A set of press releases were given out over three days.
[
11
]


In the years after World War II, the laboratory was formally established as a research government facility under the civilian control of the 
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
, and is now known as 
Los Alamos National Laboratory
. In 1957, the AEC pulled back the security perimeter to the laboratory itself and opened up the town for visits by the general public.  The first visitor to enter the town that year without a permit from the federal government was New Mexico Governor 
Edwin L. Mechem
.
[
12
]
  The AEC was later succeeded by the 
U.S. Department of Energy
.



Geography
[
edit
]


Los Alamos is located in northern New Mexico between the Rio Grande and the eastern rim of the 
Valles Caldera
 on the Pajarito Plateau, approximately 35 mi (56 km) to the northwest of 
Santa Fe
. The elevation at the post office is 7,320 feet (2,230 m) and total land area is 11.14 square miles (28.9 km
2
).

The Los Alamos Townsite and White Rock are located on flat 
mesa tops
 separated by steep canyons. This location was chosen for its relative inaccessibility to help protect the secret activities of the Manhattan Project.

The town of Los Alamos was built on four mesas—Barranca Mesa, North Mesa, Los Alamos Mesa and South Mesa—along with the connecting communities at the base of the mountain. 
Los Alamos National Laboratory
 occupies half of South Mesa, Two Mile Mesa, Frijoles Mesa, Mesita de Buey and several nearby areas in the region (in the valleys and at the base of the mountain). White Rock lies at the top of White Rock Canyon.

Much of Los Alamos County is within the Española Ranger District of the 
Santa Fe National Forest
.

Wildlife and vegetation
[
edit
]


Los Alamos' geographical location causes its wildlife and vegetation to be diverse compared to surrounding areas in the state. "The variation in elevation creates precipitation and temperature gradients that support a wide diversity of plant communities..."
[
17
]
 There are six different 
plant communities
 within the county; each is home to unique 
flora
 and 
fauna
.
[
17
]


Ponderosa pine trees
 are the most common trees at the elevation of Los Alamos (7,000 and 8,000 feet (2,100 and 2,400 m)). Common shrubs in the area include 
sagebrush
, 
Gambel oak
, and 
wild rose
.
[
17
]


Black bears
 (brown-color variation), 
elk
, 
mule deer
, 
bobcats
, 
gray foxes
, 
skunks
 and 
chipmunks
 are examples of mammals living in the area.
[
18
]

"Over 200 species of birds have been reported" in the 
Pajarito Ornithological Survey
 conducted by LANL.
[
19
]

Among these are 
broad-tailed hummingbirds
, 
hairy woodpeckers
, 
zone-tailed hawks
, 
common ravens
, 
western bluebirds
, and 
great horned owls
.

Wildfires
[
edit
]


Wildfires
 have affected the county, but the most destructive to the townsite was the 
Cerro Grande Fire
 of May 2000, which caused an estimated $1 billion in damages and destroyed more than 400 homes. The town was evacuated for eight days. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency
 (FEMA) built temporary housing on North Mesa for those who were displaced by the fire. Though there was no loss of life, other effects include damage to LANL facilities (
nuclear material
 was not affected), flash-flooding, and erosion. 

The 
Las Conchas Fire
 of June 26, 2011
[
20
]
 burned about three times as many acres and also prompted evacuation of Los Alamos, but there was no damage to property in Los Alamos.
[
21
]
 It was the biggest wildfire New Mexico had endured until the Calf Canyon-Hermits Peak fire in 2022.

Environmental remediation
[
edit
]


Over two thousand sites in the area have been determined to have been impacted as a result of past activities at LANL. The location of these sites have been identified throughout the county, and are primarily (but not exclusively) on DOE property. Contaminated sites vary widely in significance. Corrective action and environmental restoration has been deemed necessary for certain areas; LANL takes part in this process.
[
28
]
 Some residents have voiced concern about a lack of public participation and opportunity to comment on the cleanup schedule and funding.

Los Alamos is demographically unique compared to its surrounding counties and the state as a whole. Over 35% of the population of surrounding counties (
Rio Arriba
, 
Santa Fe
, and 
Sandoval
) and the state of New Mexico are Hispanic or Latino, while only about 20% of Los Alamosans are Hispanic or Latino. The white and especially the Asian populations of Los Alamos are significantly higher than the rest of New Mexico.
