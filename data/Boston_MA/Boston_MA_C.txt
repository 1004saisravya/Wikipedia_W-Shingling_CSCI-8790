Boston[a]is thecapitalandmost populous cityof the U.S. state ofMassachusetts. It serves as the cultural andfinancial centerofNew England, a region of theNortheastern United States. Boston has an area of 48.4 sq mi (125 km2)[9]and a population of 675,647 as of the2020 census, making it the third-most populous city in the Northeastern United States afterNew York CityandPhiladelphia.[4]The largerGreater Bostonmetropolitan statistical area had a population of 4.9 million in 2023, making it the largest metropolitan area in New England and theeleventh-largestin theUnited States.[10][11][12]
Boston was founded onShawmut Peninsulain 1630 by EnglishPuritansettlers, who named the city after the market town ofBoston, Lincolnshirein England.[13][14]During theAmerican RevolutionandRevolutionary War, Boston was home to several seminal events, including theBoston Massacre(1770), theBoston Tea Party(1773),Paul Revere's midnight ride(1775), theBattle of Bunker Hill(1775), and theSiege of Boston(1775–1776).
Following American independence fromGreat Britain, Boston played an important national role as a port, manufacturing hub, and education and culture center,[15][16]and the city expanded significantly beyond the originalpeninsulaby filling in land and annexing neighboring towns. Boston's many firsts include the nation's first public park (Boston Common, 1634),[17]the firstpublic school(Boston Latin School, 1635),[18]and the first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897).[19]
Boston later emerged as a global leader in higher education and research[20]and is the largestbiotechnologyhub in the world as of 2023.[21]The city is a national leader in scientific research, law, medicine, engineering, and business. With nearly 5,000 startup companies, the city is considered a global pioneer ininnovation,entrepreneurship,[22][23][24]andartificial intelligence.[25]Boston's economy is led byfinance,[26]professional and business services,information technology, and government.[27]Boston households provide the highest average rate ofphilanthropyin the nation as of 2013,[28]and the city's businesses and institutions rank among the top in the nation for environmentalsustainabilityand new investment.[29]


### Etymology
Isaac Johnson—in one of his last official acts as leader of theCharlestowncommunity before his death on September 30, 1630—named the new settlement across theriver"Boston" after Johnson's hometown ofBoston, Lincolnshire, from where he, his wife (namesake of theArbella), andJohn Cotton(grandfather ofCotton Mather)emigrated. The name of the English town derives from its patron saint,St. Botolph, inwhose churchCotton served as the rector until he and Johnson emigrated toNew England. In early sources, Lincolnshire's Boston was known as "St. Botolph's town," which was later abbreviated as "Boston." Before this renaming, the settlement on the peninsula was known as "Shawmut" byWilliam Blaxtonand "Tremontaine" by the Puritan settlers he invited.[30][31][32][33][34][35]


### History


### Indigenous era
Prior toEuropean colonization, the region surrounding present-day Boston was inhabited by theMassachusettpeople who established small, seasonal communities in present-day Boston.[36][37]In 1630, settlers led byJohn Winthroparrived, and foundShawmut Peninsulanearly empty of Native people. Most had died of European diseases borne by earlier settlers and traders.[38][39]Archaeological excavations have unearthed one of the oldestfishweirsin New England, located onBoylston Street, which Native people constructed as early as 7,000 years before European arrival in theWestern Hemisphere.[37][36][40]


### European settlement
The first European to live in what would become Boston was aUniversity of Cambridge-educatedAnglicancleric namedWilliam Blaxton. He was most directly responsible for the foundation of Boston byPuritancolonists in 1630, after Blaxton invited one of their leaders,Isaac Johnson, to crossBack Bayfrom the failing colony ofCharlestownand share the peninsula with him. In September 1630 Puritans made the crossing to present-day Boston.[41][42][43]
Puritan influence on Boston began even before the settlement was founded with the 1629Cambridge Agreement, which was created theMassachusetts Bay Colonyand signed by the colony's first governor,John Winthrop. Puritan ethics and their focus on education also influenced the city's early history. In 1635, America's first public school,Boston Latin School, was founded in Boston.[18][44]
Boston was the largest town in theThirteen ColoniesuntilPhiladelphiaoutgrew it in the mid-18th century.[45]Boston'soceanfront locationmade it a livelyport, and the town engaged inshippingand fishing during the colonial era. Boston was a primary stop on theCaribbeantrade routeand imported large amounts of molasses, which led to the creation ofBoston baked beans.[46]
Boston's economy stagnated in the decades prior to the American Revolution. By the mid-18th century, New York City and Philadelphia both surpassed Boston in wealth. During this period, Boston encountered financial difficulties even as other New England cities were growing rapidly.[47][48]


### American Revolution and Siege of Boston
The weather continuing boisterous the next day and night, giving the enemy time to improve their works, to bring up their cannon, and to put themselves in such a state of defence, that I could promise myself little success in attacking them under all the disadvantages I had to encounter.
Boston played a central role in theAmerican Revolution. Many crucial events of the American Revolution and subsequentAmerican Revolutionary Waroccurred in or near Boston, where the city's revolutionary spirit[50]againstBritain'scolonialgovernance was demonstrable and ultimately inspiring to the rest of theThirteen Colonies.[47]When theBritish Parliamentpassed theStamp Actin 1765, the homes ofAndrew Oliver, the official tasked with enforcing the Act, andThomas Hutchinson, then lieutenant governor ofMassachusetts Bay Colony, were raved by Boston mobs.[47][51]The British responded by sending two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the revolt, but the increased British military presence in Boston only ended up further inflaming the Boston colonists. In 1770, during theBoston Massacre,British troopsfired into a Boston mob that was protesting their presence. The massacre forced the British to withdraw their troops and helped fuel revolutionary sentiment in the colonies.[48]
In May 1773, Parliament passed theTea Act, which many colonists saw as a British attempt to compel them to accept taxes established by theTownshend Acts. This led to theBoston Tea Party, a defining event of the American Revolution in which angered Bostonians threw an entire shipment of tea sent from theEast India CompanyintoBoston Harbor, escalating the American Revolution. The British monarchy responded furiously, implementing theIntolerable Actsand demanding compensation for the tea destroyed during the Boston Tea Party.[47]This response, in turn, angered the colonists further, leading to theBattles of Lexington and Concordon April 19, 1775, the first battles of theAmerican Revolutionary War, which were fought around Boston in Massachusetts Bay Colony.[47][52]
During thesiege of Bostonfrom April 19, 1775, to March 17, 1776, New England-basedPatriotmilitia impeded movement by theBritish Army.Sir William Howe, then commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June 17, the British captured Charlestown in present-day Boston during theBattle of Bunker Hillduring which the British Army outnumbered Patriot militia. But the British sustained irreplaceable casualties, turning the Battle of Bunker Hill into apyrrhic victoryfor the British. The Battle of Bunker Hill also demonstrated the skill and training of the Patriot militia, whose stubborn defense made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without suffering even further casualties.[53][54]
On June 14, 1775, in an effort to unify the Revolutionary War effort, theSecond Continental Congress, convening in the colonial-era capital ofPhiladelphia, founded theContinental Armyand unanimously appointedGeorge Washingtonas its commander-in-chief. Washington then immediately departed Philadelphia for Boston, where he arrived on July 2, 1775, and led the newly-formed Continental Army in the siege. Fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes, and the Continental Army faced challenges with a deficiency of munitions and supplies.Boston Neck, then narrow and only approximately 100 feet wide, impeded Washington's ability to invade Boston, which led to a prolonged stalemate between the Continental Army and British forces. A young officer,Rufus Putnam, came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood, which were erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness. Putnam supervised the effort, which successfully installed the fortifications and dozens of cannons onDorchester HeightsthatHenry Knoxlaboriously brought through the snow fromFort Ticonderoga. The following morning, the astonished British Army awoke to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them. General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his British Army could have done in six months. The British Army responded by attempting to launch a cannon barrage for two hours, but their shots could not reach the Continental Army's cannons at such a height. The British then gave up, boarded their ships, and sailed away from Boston in what has come to be known as "Evacuation Day", which is now celebrated in Boston annually on March 17. After the British retreat, Washington was so impressed with the effort of Rufus Putnam that he appointed him as his chief engineer.[52][53][55]


### Post-revolution and the War of 1812
After the Revolution, Boston's longseafaringtradition helped make it one of the nation's busiest ports for both domestic and international trade. Boston's harbor activity was significantly curtailed by theEmbargo Act of 1807, which was adopted during theNapoleonic Wars, and theWar of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the meantime. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. The small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.[56]
During this period, Boston also flourished culturally. It was admired for itsrarefied literary lifeand generousartistic patronage.[57][58]Members of old Boston families, later dubbed "Boston Brahmins", came to be regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites.[59]They are often associated with theAmerican upper class,Harvard University,[60]and theEpiscopal Church.[61][62]
Boston was a prominent port of theAtlantic slave tradein theNew England Colonies, but was soon overtaken bySalem, Massachusetts, andNewport, Rhode Island.[63]Boston eventually became a center of theAmerican abolitionist movement.[64]The city reacted largely negatively to theFugitive Slave Act of 1850,[65]contributing to PresidentFranklin Pierce's attempt to make an example of Boston afterAnthony Burns's attempt to escape to freedom.[66][67]
In 1822,[15]the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from the "Town of Boston" to the "City of Boston", and on March 19, 1822, the people of Boston accepted thecharter incorporating the city.[68]At the time Boston was chartered as a city, the population was about 46,226, while the area of the city was only 4.8 sq mi (12 km2).[68]


### 19th century
In the 1820s, Boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of Europeanimmigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following theGreat Famine; by 1850, about 35,000Irish lived in Boston.[69]In the latter half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish,Germans,Lebanese, Syrians,[70]French Canadians, andRussianandPolish Jewssettling there.
By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants with their residence yielding lasting cultural change.Italiansbecame the largest inhabitants of theNorth End,[71]IrishdominatedSouth BostonandCharlestown, andRussianJewslived in theWest End.IrishandItalianimmigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community,[72]and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include theKennedys,Tip O'Neill, andJohn F. Fitzgerald.[73]
Between 1631 and 1890, the city tripled its area throughland reclamationby filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of theSouth End, theWest End, theFinancial District, andChinatown.[74]
After theGreat Boston fire of 1872, workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600 acres (240 ha) of brackish Charles River marshlands west ofBoston Commonwith gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. The city annexed the adjacent towns ofSouth Boston(1804),East Boston(1836),Roxbury(1868),Dorchester(including present-dayMattapanand a portion ofSouth Boston) (1870),Brighton(including present-dayAllston) (1874),West Roxbury(including present-dayJamaica PlainandRoslindale) (1874),Charlestown(1874), andHyde Park(1912).[75][76]Other proposals were unsuccessful for the annexation ofBrookline, Cambridge,[77]andChelsea.[78][79]


### 20th century
Many architecturally significant buildings were built during the early years of the 20th century:Horticultural Hall,[80]theTennis and Racquet Club,[81]Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum,[82][83]Fenway Studios,[84]Jordan Hall,[85]and theBoston Opera House.  TheLongfellow Bridge,[86]built in 1906, was mentioned byRobert McCloskeyinMake Way for Ducklings, describing its "salt and pepper shakers" feature.[87]Fenway Park, home of theBoston Red Sox, opened in 1912,[88]with theBoston Gardenopening in 1928.[89]Logan International Airportopened on September 8, 1923.[90]
Kennedy Sr. had this to say before the Boston Chamber of Commerce on November 15, 1934: “The rogues who seek to live by deception-let me again repeat, the act is like all legal rules, subject to the limitations of effective legal action. Unfortunately, scoundrels will capitalize the registration requirements and may seek to sell you a security on the theory that mere filing indicates approval by the Commission. Beware of any such argument. Our short experience as to this legislation prompts me to sound a note of warning, particularly to you, my friends of the radio audience.  Each and everyone of you is a prospective or actual member of a "sucker" list, and when the stranger calls you on the phone to interest you in the purchase of securities, beware.”[91]
By the early- to mid-20th century, Boston declined economically as factories became old and obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.[92]Boston responded by initiating variousurban renewalprojects, under the direction of theBoston Redevelopment Authority(BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition, and thousands of families were displaced.[93]
The BRA continued implementingeminent domainprojects, including the clearance of the vibrantScollay Squarearea for construction of the modernist styleGovernment Center. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in theDorchesterneighborhood, the firstCommunity Health Centerin the United States. It mostly served the massiveColumbia Pointpublic housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center.[94]The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized from 1984 to 1990 into a mixed-income residential development called Harbor Point Apartments.[95]
By the 1970s, the city's economy had begun to recover after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high-rises were constructed in theFinancial Districtand in Boston'sBack Bayduring this period.[96]This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such asMassachusetts General Hospital,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, andBrigham and Women's Hospitallead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as theBoston Architectural College,Boston College,Boston University,Harvard Medical School,Tufts University School of Medicine,Northeastern University,Massachusetts College of Art and Design,Wentworth Institute of Technology,Berklee College of Music,Boston Conservatory, and others attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 overdesegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.[97]Boston has also experiencedgentrificationin the latter half of the 20th century,[98]with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s when the city'srent controlregime was struck down by statewideballot proposition.[99]


### 21st century
Boston is an intellectual, technological, and political center. However, it has lost some important regional institutions,[100]including the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such asFleetBoston Financial, which was acquired byCharlotte-basedBank of Americain 2004.[101]Boston-based department storesJordan MarshandFilene'shave both merged into theNew York City–basedMacy's.[102]The 1993 acquisition ofThe Boston GlobebyThe New York Times[103]was reversed in 2013 when it was resold to Boston businessmanJohn W. Henry. In 2016, it was announcedGeneral Electricwould be moving its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to theSeaport Districtin Boston, joining many other companies in this rapidly developing neighborhood.[104]The city also saw the completion of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, known as theBig Dig, in 2007 after many delays and cost overruns.[105]
On April 15, 2013, two Chechen Islamist brothersdetonated a pair of bombsnear the finish line of theBoston Marathon, killing three people and injuring roughly 264.[106]The subsequent search for the bombers led to a lock-down of Boston and surrounding municipalities. The region showed solidarity during this time as symbolized by the sloganBoston Strong.[107]
In 2016, Boston brieflyshouldered a bidas the U.S. applicant for the2024 Summer Olympics. The bid was supported by the mayor and a coalition of business leaders and local philanthropists, but was eventually dropped due to public opposition.[108]TheUSOCthen selectedLos Angelesto be the American candidate with Los Angeles ultimately securing the right to host the2028 Summer Olympics.[109]Nevertheless, Boston is one of eleven U.S. cities which will host matches during the2026 FIFA World Cup, with games taking place atGillette Stadium.[110]


### Geography
The geographical center of Boston is inRoxbury. Due north of the center we find the South End. This is not to be confused with South Boston which lies directly east from the South End. North of South Boston is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End
Boston has an area of 89.63 sq mi (232.1 km2). Of this area, 48.4 sq mi (125.4 km2), or 54%, of it is land and 41.2 sq mi (106.7 km2), or 46%, of it is water. The city's elevation, as measured atLogan International Airport, is 19 ft (5.8 m)above sea level.[112]The highest point in Boston isBellevue Hillat 330 ft (100 m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level.[113]The city is adjacent toBoston Harbor, an arm ofMassachusetts Bay, and by extension, the Atlantic Ocean.
Boston is surrounded by theGreater Bostonmetropolitan region. It is bordered to the east by the town ofWinthropand theBoston Harbor Islands, to the northeast by the cities ofRevere,ChelseaandEverett, to the north by the cities ofSomervilleandCambridge, to the northwest byWatertown, to the west by the city ofNewtonand town ofBrookline, to the southwest by the town ofDedhamand small portions ofNeedhamandCanton, and to the southeast by the town ofMilton, and the city ofQuincy.
TheCharles Riverseparates Boston'sAllston-Brighton,Fenway-KenmoreandBack Bayneighborhoods fromWatertownand Cambridge, and most of Boston from its ownCharlestownneighborhood. TheNeponset Riverforms the boundary between Boston's southern neighborhoods andQuincyandMilton. TheMystic Riverseparates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, andChelsea Creekand Boston Harbor separateEast BostonfromDowntown, theNorth End, and theSeaport.[114]


### Neighborhoods
Boston is sometimes called a "city of neighborhoods" because of the profusion of diverse subsections.[115][116]The city government's Office of Neighborhood Services has designated 23 neighborhoods:[117]
More than two-thirds of inner Boston's modern land area did not exist when the city was founded. Instead, it was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries.[74]This was accomplished using earth from the leveling or lowering of Boston's three original hills, the "Trimountain", after which Tremont Street is named, and with gravel brought by train from Needham to fill theBack Bay.[16]
Christian Science Center,Copley Square,Newbury Street, and New England's two tallest buildings: theJohn Hancock Towerand thePrudential Center.[118][119]Near the John Hancock Tower is theold John Hancock Buildingwith its prominentilluminated beacon, the color of which forecasts the weather.[120]
Downtownand its immediate surroundings (including the Financial District, Government Center, andSouth Boston) consist largely of low-rise masonry buildings – oftenfederal styleandGreek revival– interspersed with modern high-rises.[121]Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such as theBoston Public Library,[122]Trinity Church, single-family homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses. The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighborhood in the US.[123]
The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly affected by the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (which ran from 1991 to 2007, and was known unofficially as the "Big Dig"). That project removed the elevatedCentral Arteryand incorporated new green spaces and open areas.[124]


### Environment
Boston is located within the Boston Basinecoregion, which is characterized by low and rolling hills with a number of ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. Forests are mainly transition hardwoods such asoak-hickorymixed withwhite pine.[125]As a coastal city built largely onfill,sea-level riseis of major concern to the city government. A climate action plan from 2019 anticipates 2 ft (1 m) to more than 7 ft (2 m) of sea-level rise in Boston by the end of the 21st century.[126]Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported bywooden pilesdriven into the area's fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but are subject todry rotif exposed to air for long periods.[127]Groundwaterlevels have been dropping in many areas of the city, due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. The Boston Groundwater Trust coordinates monitoring groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells.[128]
The city developed a climate action plan coveringcarbon reductionin buildings, transportation, and energy use. The first such plan was commissioned in 2007, with updates released in 2011, 2014, and 2019.[129]This plan includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and to partake in anenergy assessmentevery five years.[130]A separate initiative, Resilient Boston Harbor, lays out neighborhood-specific recommendations forcoastal resilience.[131]In 2013, Mayor Thomas Menino introduced the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive which reduces the cost of living in buildings that are deemed energy efficient.[132]


### Climate
Under theKöppen climate classification, Boston has either a hot-summerhumid continental climate(KöppenDfa) under the 0 °C (32.0 °F) isotherm or ahumid subtropical climate(KöppenCfa) under the −3 °C (26.6 °F) isotherm.[133]Summers are warm to hot and humid. Winters are cold and stormy, with occasional periods of heavy snow. Spring and fall are usually cool and mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and the position of thejet stream. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. In winter, areas near the immediate coast often see more rain than snow, as warm air is sometimes drawn off the Atlantic.[134]Boston lies at the border betweenUSDAplanthardiness zones6b (away from the coastline) and 7a (close to the coastline).[135]Receiving over 2,600 hours of sunshine annually, Boston is one of the sunniest oceanic cities located at its latitude globally.
The warmest month is July, with a mean temperature of 74.1 °F (23.4 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of 29.9 °F (−1.2 °C). Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but tend to be fairly short, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively.[136]
Sub- 0 °F (−18 °C) readings usually occur every 3 to 5 years.[137]The most recent sub- 0 °F (−18 °C) reading occurred on February 4, 2023, when the temperature dipped down to −10 °F (−23 °C). This was the lowest temperature reading in Boston since 1957.[136]Several decades may pass between 100 °F (38 °C) readings. The last such reading occurred on July 24, 2022.[136]Boston's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 to April 5.[136][b]Official temperature records have ranged from −18 °F (−28 °C) on February 9, 1934, up to 104 °F (40 °C) on July 4, 1911. The record cold daily maximum is 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917. The record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on both August 2, 1975 and July 21, 2019.[138][136]
Boston averages 43.6 in (1,110 mm) ofprecipitationa year, with 49.2 in (125 cm) of snowfall per season.[136]Most snowfall occurs from mid-November to early April. Snow is rare in May and October.[139][140]There is high year-to-year variability in snowfall. For instance, the winter of 2011–12 saw only 9.3 in (23.6 cm) of accumulating snow, but the previous winter, the corresponding figure was 81.0 in (2.06 m).[136][c]Boston's coastal location on theNorth Atlanticmakes the city very prone tonor'easters, which can produce large amounts of snow and rain.[134]
Fog is relatively common, particularly in spring and early summer. Due to its coastal location, Boston often receivessea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 °F (11 °C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday.[141][142]Thunderstorms typically occur from May to September. Occasionally, they can become severe, with largehail, damaging winds, and heavy downpours.[134]Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violenttornado, Boston has experienced manytornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city.[143]

### Demographics
In the2020 census, Boston was estimated to have 691,531 residents living in 266,724 households[4]—a 12% population increase over 2010. Boston is thethird-most densely populated large U.S. cityof over half a million residents, and the most densely populated state capital. Some 1.2 million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, and as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.[165]
In 2011, 21.9% of the population was aged 19 and under, 14.3% was from 20 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.9 males.[166]There were 252,699 households, of which 20.4% had children under the age of 18 living in them, 25.5% were married couples living together, 16.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.0% were non-families. 37.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 3.08.[166]
In 2011, themedian household incomein Boston was $51,739, while the median income for a family was $61,035. Full-time year-round male workers had a median income of $52,544 versus $46,540 for full-time year-round female workers. The per capita income for the city was $33,158. 21.4% of the population and 16.0% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 28.8% of those under the age of 18 and 20.4% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.[167]Boston has a significantracial wealth gapwith White Bostonians having a median net worth of $247,500 compared to an $8 median net worth for non-immigrant Black residents and $0 for Dominican immigrant residents.[168]
From the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, the proportion ofnon-Hispanic Whitesin Boston declined. In 2000, non-Hispanic Whites were 49.5% of Boston's population, making the citymajority minorityfor the first time. In the 21st century, Boston has experienced significantgentrification, during which affluent Whites have moved into formerly non-White areas. In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated non-Hispanic Whites again formed a slight majority. As of 2010, in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available, the non-White population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increasedLatin AmericanandAsianpopulations and more clarity surrounding U.S. Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic White population of 47% (some reports give slightly lower figures).[169][170][171]


### Ethnicity
In 2011,African-Americanscomprised 22% of the city's population.

Like many major American cities, Boston has experienced a great reduction in violent crime since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston Police Department's collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from theUnited States Attorney and District Attorney's offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle". In 1999, murders in Boston dropped from 152 in 1990, a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people, to 31—not one of them a juvenile, for a 1999 murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000.[248]
