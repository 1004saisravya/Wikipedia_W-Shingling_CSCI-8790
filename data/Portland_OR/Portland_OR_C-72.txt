PORT
-lənd
) is the 
most populous city
 in the U.S. state of 
Oregon
. Located in the 
Pacific Northwest
 at the confluence of the 
Willamette
 and 
Columbia
 rivers, it is the 
28th-most populous city
 in the United States, sixth most populous on the 
West Coast
, and third most populous in the Pacific Northwest (after 
Seattle
 and 
Vancouver
) with a population of 652,503 at the 
2020 census
,
[
11
]
 while the 
Portland metropolitan area
 with over 2.54 million residents is the 
26th-largest metropolitan area
 in the nation. Almost half of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metro area.
[
a
]
 It is the 
county seat
 of 
Multnomah County
, Oregon's most populous county.

Named after 
Portland, Maine
,
[
12
]
 which is itself named after England's 
Isle of Portland
, the Oregon settlement began to be populated near the end of the 
Oregon Trail
 in the 1840s. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber industry was a major force in the city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city had a reputation as one of the most dangerous 
port cities
 in the world, and was a hub for organized crime and 
racketeering
; this reputation dissipated after its economy experienced an industrial boom during 
World War II
, and it became known for its growing 
liberal
 and 
progressive
 political values from the 1960s onwards,
[
13
]
 earning it a reputation as a bastion of 
counterculture
 exemplified by the popular slogan "
Keep Portland Weird
".
[
14
]
 This aspect of the city has since been championed by organizations such as 
Weird Portland United
[
15
]
 and the comedy series 
Portlandia
 (2011–2018).
[
16
]


The city operates with a 
mayor–council government
 system, guided by a 
mayor
 and 12 
city councilors
, as well as 
Metro
, the only directly elected 
metropolitan planning organization
 in the United States.
[
17
]
[
18
]
 Its climate is marked by warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. This climate is 
ideal for growing roses
,  and Portland has been called the "City of Roses" for over a century.

History
[
edit

Main article: 
History of Portland, Oregon


For a chronological guide, see 
Timeline of Portland, Oregon
.


Before European settlement
[
edit
]


During the prehistoric period, the land that would become Portland 
was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams
 from 
Lake Missoula
, in what would later become Montana. These massive floods occurred during the last ice age and filled the 
Willamette Valley
 with 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) of water.
[
20
]


Before American settlers began arriving in the 1800s, the land was inhabited for many centuries by two bands of indigenous 
Chinook people
 – the 
Multnomah
 and the 
Clackamas
.
[
21
]
 The Chinook people occupying the land were first documented 
in 1805
 by 
Meriwether Lewis
 and 
William Clark
.
[
22
]
 Before its European settlement, the Portland Basin of the lower Columbia River and Willamette River valleys had been one of the most densely populated regions on the Pacific Coast.
[
22

Establishment
[
edit
]


Pioneer Courthouse
, 1886


1890 map of Portland


Large numbers of pioneer settlers began arriving in the Willamette Valley in the 1840s via the 
Oregon Trail
 with many arriving in nearby 
Oregon City
.
[
23
]
 A new settlement then emerged ten miles from the mouth of the Willamette River,
[
24
]
 roughly halfway between Oregon City and 
Hudson's Bay Company
's 
Fort Vancouver
. This community was initially referred to as "Stumptown" and "The Clearing" because of the many trees cut down to allow for its growth.
[
25
]
 In 1843 
William Overton
 saw potential in the new settlement but lacked the funds to file an official land claim. For 25 cents, Overton agreed to share half of the 640-acre (2.6 km
2
) site with 
Asa Lovejoy
 of 
Boston
.
[
26
]


In 1844, Overton sold his remaining half of the claim to 
Francis W. Pettygrove
 of 
Portland, Maine
. Both Pettygrove and Lovejoy wished to rename "The Clearing" after their respective hometowns (Lovejoy's being Boston, and Pettygrove's, Portland). This controversy was settled with a coin toss that Pettygrove won in a series of two out of three tosses, thereby providing Portland with its namesake.
[
2
]
 The coin used for this decision, now known as the 
Portland Penny
, is on display in the headquarters of the 
Oregon Historical Society
. At the time of its incorporation on February 8, 1851, Portland had over 800 inhabitants,
[
27
]
 a steam sawmill, a log cabin hotel, and a newspaper, the 
Weekly Oregonian
. 
A major fire swept through downtown in August 1873
, destroying twenty blocks on the west side of the Willamette along Yamhill and Morrison Streets, and causing $1.3 million in damage,
[
28
]
 roughly equivalent to $34.1 million today.
[
29
]
 By 1879, the population had grown to 17,500 and by 1890 it had grown to 46,385.
[
30
]
 In 1888, the first steel bridge on the 
West Coast
 was opened in Portland,
[
31
]
 the predecessor of the 1912 namesake 
Steel Bridge
 that survives today. In 1889, Henry Pittock's wife, Georgiana, established the Portland Rose Society. The annual Portland Rose Festival" is held here in June.
[
32
]
 The movement to make Portland a "Rose City" started as the city was preparing for the 1905 
Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition
.
[
19
]


Portland's access to the 
Pacific Ocean
 via the Willamette and Columbia rivers, as well as its easy access to the agricultural 
Tualatin Valley
 via the "
Great Plank Road
" (the route of current-day 
U.S. Route 26
), provided the pioneer city with an advantage over other nearby ports, and it grew very quickly.
[
33
]
 Portland remained the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when Seattle's deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by rail, affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the Columbia River. The city had its own Japantown,
[
34
]
 for one, and the 
lumber industry
 also became a prominent economic presence, due to the area's large population of 
Douglas fir
, 
western hemlock
, 
red cedar
, and 
big leaf maple
 trees.
[
22
]




Portland waterfront in 1898


Portland developed a reputation early in its history as a hard-edged and gritty 
port town
.
[
35
]
 Some historians have described the city's early establishment as being a "
scion
 of 
New England
; an ends-of-the-earth home for the exiled spawn of the eastern established elite."
[
36
]
 In 1889, 
The Oregonian
 called Portland "the most filthy city in the Northern States", due to the unsanitary sewers and gutters,
[
37
]
 and, at the turn of the 20th century, it was considered one of the most dangerous port cities in the world.
[
38
]
 The city housed a large number of saloons, 
bordellos
, gambling dens, and boarding houses which were populated with miners after the 
California gold rush
, as well as the multitude of sailors passing through the port.
[
35
]
 By the early 20th century, the city had lost its reputation as a "sober frontier city" and garnered a reputation for being violent and dangerous.
[

20th-century development
[
edit

White Eagle Saloon
 (c. 1910), one of many in Portland that had reputed ties to illegal activities such as 
gambling
 rackets and 
prostitution
[
40
]
 
Burnside Street
, 1937


Between 1900 and 1930, the city's population tripled from nearly 100,000 to 301,815.
[
41
]
 During 
World War II
, it housed an "assembly center" from which up to 3,676 people of Japanese descent were dispatched to 
internment camps
 in the heartland. It was the first American city to have residents report thus,
[
42
]
 and the 
Pacific International Livestock Exposition
 operated from May through September 10, 1942, processing people from the city, northern Oregon, and 
central Washington
.
[
43
]
 General 
John DeWitt
 called the city the first "Jap-free city on the West Coast".
[
42
]


At the same time, Portland became a notorious hub for underground criminal activity and 
organized crime
 in the 1940s and 1950s.
[
44
]
 In 1957, 
Life
 magazine published an article detailing the city's history of 
government corruption
 and crime, specifically its gambling rackets and illegal nightclubs.
[
44
]
 The article, which focused on 
crime boss
 
Jim Elkins
, became the basis of a fictionalized film titled 
Portland Exposé
 (1957). In spite of the city's seedier undercurrent of criminal activity, Portland enjoyed an economic and industrial surge during World War II. Ship builder 
Henry J. Kaiser
 had been awarded contracts to build 
Liberty ships
 and aircraft carrier escorts, and chose sites in Portland and 
Vancouver, Washington
, for work yards.
[
45
]
 During this time, Portland's population rose by over 150,000, largely attributed to recruited laborers.
[
45
]


During the 1960s, an influx of 
hippie
 subculture began to take root in the city in the wake of 
San Francisco
's burgeoning 
countercultural
 scene.
[
13
]
 The city's 
Crystal Ballroom
 became a hub for the city's 
psychedelic culture
, while 
food cooperatives
 and listener-funded media and radio stations were established.
[
46
]
 A large 
social activist
 presence evolved during this time as well, specifically concerning 
Native American rights
, 
environmentalist
 causes, and 
gay rights
.
[
46
]
 By the 1970s, Portland had well established itself as a progressive city, and experienced an economic boom for the majority of the decade; however, the slowing of the housing market in 1979 caused demand for the city and state timber industries to drop significantly.
[
47
]




Since 1990
[
edit
]

In the 1990s, the technology industry began to emerge in Portland, specifically with the establishment of companies such as 
Intel
, which brought more than 
US$
10 billion in investments in 1995 alone.
[
48
]
 In the late 1990s, the Portland area was rated the fourth-least affordable place in the United States to purchase a new home.
[
49
]
 After 2000, Portland experienced significant growth, with a population rise of over 90,000 between 2000 and 2014.
[
50
]
 The city's increasing reputation for culture established it as a popular city for young people, and it was second only to 
Louisville, Kentucky
, as one of the cities to attract and retain the highest number of college-educated people in the United States.
[
51
]
 Between 2001 and 2012, Portland's gross domestic product per person grew by fifty percent, more than any other city in the country.
[
51
]


The city acquired a 
diverse range of nicknames
 throughout its history, though it is most often called "Rose City" or "The City of Roses"
[
52
]
 (unofficial nickname since 1888, official since 2003).
[
53
]
 Another widely used nickname by local residents in everyday speech is "PDX", the airport code for 
Portland International Airport
. Other nicknames include Bridgetown,
[

George Floyd protests at the 
Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse
, July 2020


From May 28, 2020, until spring 2021,
[
61
]
 there were daily 
protests
 about the 
murder of George Floyd
 by police, and racial injustice. There were instances of looting, vandalism, and police actions causing injuries. One protestor was killed by an opposing one.
[

 Local businesses reported losses totaling millions of dollars as the result of vandalism and looting, according to 
Oregon Public Broadcasting
.
[

 Some protests caused injury to protesters and police. In July, federal officers were deployed to safeguard federal property; their presence and tactics were criticized by Oregon officials, who demanded they leave, while lawsuits were filed against local and federal law enforcement alleging wrongful actions by them.

Geology of the Pacific Northwest


Portland lies on top of a dormant volcanic field known as the 
Boring Lava Field
, named after the nearby 
bedroom community
 of 
Boring
.
[
73
]
 The Boring Lava Field has at least 32 cinder cones such as 
Mount Tabor
,
[
74
]
 and its center lies in southeast Portland. 
Mount St. Helens
, a highly active volcano 50 miles (80 km) northeast of the city in Washington state, is easily visible on clear days and is close enough to have dusted the city with volcanic ash after its 
eruption on May 18, 1980.
[
75
]
 The rocks of the Portland area range in age from late 
Eocene
 to more recent eras.
[
76
]


Multiple shallow, active 
faults
 traverse the Portland metropolitan area.
[
77
]
 Among them are the 
Portland Hills Fault
 on the city's west side,
[
78
]
 and the 
East Bank Fault
 on the east side.
[
79
]
 According to a 2017 survey, several of these faults were characterized as "probably more of a hazard" than the 
Cascadia subduction zone
 due to their proximities to population centers, with the potential of producing 
magnitude
 7 
earthquakes
.
[
77
]
 Notable earthquakes that have impacted the Portland area in recent history include the 6.8-magnitude 
Nisqually earthquake
 in 2001, and a 5.6-magnitude earthquake that struck on March 25, 1993.
[
80
]
[
81
]


Per a 2014 report, over 7,000 locations within the Portland area are at high risk for landslides and 
soil liquefaction
 in the event of a major earthquake, including much of the city's west side (such as 
Washington Park
) and sections of 
Clackamas County
.
[
82
]




Topography
[
edit
]


Portland is 60 miles (97 km) east of the Pacific Ocean at the northern end of 
Oregon
's most populated region, the Willamette Valley. Downtown Portland straddles the banks of the Willamette River, which flows north through the city center and separates the city's east and west neighborhoods. Less than 10 miles (16 km) from downtown, the Willamette River flows into the Columbia River, the fourth-largest river in the United States, which divides Oregon from Washington state. Portland is approximately 100 miles (160 km) upriver from the Pacific Ocean on the Columbia.

Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the 
Tualatin Mountains
, more commonly referred to locally as the "West Hills", pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. 
Council Crest Park
 at 1,073 feet (327 m) is often quoted as the highest point in Portland; however, the highest point in Portland is on a section of NW Skyline Blvd just north of 
Willamette Stone Heritage site
.
[
83
]
 The highest point east of the river is 
Mt. Tabor
, an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to 636 feet (194 m). Nearby 
Powell Butte
 and 
Rocky Butte
 rise to 614 feet (187 m) and 612 feet (187 m), respectively. To the west of the Tualatin Mountains lies the 
Oregon Coast Range
, and to the east lies the actively volcanic 
Cascade Range
. On clear days, 
Mt. Hood
 and 
Mt. St. Helens
 dominate the horizon, while 
Mt. Adams
 and 
Mt. Rainier
 can also be seen in the distance.

According to the 
United States Census Bureau
, the city has an area of 145.09 square miles (375.78 km
2
), of which 133.43 square miles (345.58 km
2
) is land and 11.66 square miles (30.20 km
2
) is water.
[
84
]
 Although almost all of Portland is within 
Multnomah County
, small portions of the city are within Clackamas and 
Washington
 counties.

Climate
[

Climate chart for Portland


Portland has a 
warm-summer Mediterranean climate
 (
Köppen
 
Csb),
 falling just short of a 
hot-summer Mediterranean climate
 (Köppen 
Csa)
 with cool and rainy winters, and warm and dry summers.
[
86
]
 This climate is characterized by having overcast, wet, and changing weather conditions in fall, winter, and spring, as Portland lies in the direct path of the stormy westerly flow, and warm, dry summers when the 
North Pacific High
 reaches its northernmost point in mid-summer.
[
87
]
 Portland's 
USDA Plant Hardiness Zone
 is 8b, with parts of the Downtown area falling into zone 9a.
[
88
]


Winters are cool, cloudy, and rainy. The coldest month is December with an average daily high temperature of 46.9 °F (8.3 °C), although overnight lows usually remain above freezing by a few degrees. Evening temperatures fall to or below freezing 32 nights per year on average, but very rarely below 18 °F (−8 °C). There are only 2.1 days per year where the daytime high temperature fails to rise above freezing; the mean for the lowest high is at the exact freezing point of 32 °F (0 °C).
[
89
]
 The lowest overnight temperature ever recorded was −3 °F (−19 °C),
[
88
]
 on February 2, 1950,
[
89
]
 while the lowest daytime high temperature ever recorded was 14 °F (−10 °C) on December 30, 1968.
[
89
]
 The average window in which freezing temperatures may occur is between November 15 and March 19, allowing a growing season of 240 days.
[
89
]


Annual snowfall in Portland is 4.3 inches (10.9 cm), which usually falls between December and March.
[
90
]
 The city of Portland avoids snow more frequently than its suburbs, due in part to its low elevation and the 
urban heat island
 effect. Neighborhoods outside of the downtown core, especially in slightly higher elevations near the 
West Hills
 and 
Mount Tabor
, can experience a dusting of snow while downtown receives no accumulation at all. The city has experienced a few major snow and ice storms in its past, with extreme totals having reached 44.5 in (113 cm) at the airport in 1949–50 and 60.9 in (155 cm) at downtown in 1892–93.

Portland's climate is 
conducive to the growth of roses
. 
(Pictured: 
International Rose Test Garden
)


Summers in Portland are warm, dry, and sunny, though the sunny warm weather is short-lived, from mid-June to early September.
[
93
]
 June, July, August and September account for a combined 4.19 inches (106 mm) of total rainfall –  only 11% of the 36.91 in (938 mm) of annual precipitation. The warmest month is August, with an average high temperature of 82.3 °F (27.9 °C). Because of its inland location 62 miles (100 km) from the coast, as well as the protective nature of the 
Oregon Coast Range
 to its west, Portland summers are less susceptible to the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean. Consequently, Portland occasionally experiences 
heat waves
, with temperatures rising above 90 °F (32 °C) for a few days. However, on average, temperatures reach or exceed 80 °F (27 °C) on only 61 days per year, of which 15 days will reach 90 °F (32 °C) and only 1.3 days will reach 100 °F (38 °C). In 2018 more 90-degree days were recorded than ever before.
[
94
]


On June 28, 2021, Portland recorded its all-time record high temperature of 116 °F (47 °C) and its warmest daily low temperature of 75 °F (24 °C) during a 
major regional heat wave
.
[
95
]
 The record had been broken for three consecutive days with daytime highs of 108 °F (42 °C) on June 26 and 112 °F (44 °C) on June 27; the previous record of 107 °F (42 °C) was set in July 1965 and matched twice in August 1981.
[
96
]
[
97
]
 A temperature of 100 °F (38 °C) has been recorded in all five months from May through September. The warmest night of the year averages 68 °F (20 °C).
[
89
]


Spring and fall can bring variable weather including high-pressure ridging that sends temperatures surging above 80 °F (27 °C) and cold fronts that plunge daytime temperatures into the 40s °F (4–9 °C). However, lengthy stretches of overcast days beginning in mid-fall and continuing into mid-spring are most common. Rain often falls as a light drizzle for several consecutive days at a time, contributing to 157 days on average with measurable (≥0.01 in or 0.25 mm) precipitation annually. Temperatures have reached 90 °F (32 °C) as early as April 30 and as late as October 5, while 80 °F (27 °C) has been reached as early as March 16 and as late as October 21. 
Thunderstorms
 are uncommon and 
tornadoes
 are very rare, although they do occur.

Downtown Portland


Portland's cityscape derives much of its character from the many bridges that span the Willamette River downtown, several of which are historic landmarks, and Portland has been nicknamed "Bridgetown" for many decades as a result.
[
54
]
 Three of downtown's most heavily used bridges are more than 100 years old and are designated historic landmarks: 
Hawthorne Bridge
 (1910), 
Steel Bridge
 (1912), and 
Broadway Bridge
 (1913). Portland's newest bridge in the downtown area, 
Tilikum Crossing
, opened in 2015 and is the first new bridge to span the Willamette in Portland since the 1973 opening of the double-decker 
Fremont Bridge
.
[
104
]


Other bridges that span the Willamette River in the downtown area include the 
Burnside Bridge
, the 
Ross Island Bridge
 (both built 1926), and the double-decker 
Marquam Bridge
 (built 1966). Other bridges outside the downtown area include the 
Sellwood Bridge
 (built 2016) to the south; and the 
St. Johns Bridge
, a 
Gothic revival
 suspension bridge built in 1931, to the north. The 
Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge
 and the 
Interstate Bridge
 provide access from Portland across the Columbia River into Washington state.

The five previous addressing sectors of Portland, prior to the addition of South Portland


The Willamette River, which flows north through downtown, serves as the natural boundary between East and West Portland. The denser and earlier-developed west side extends into the lap of the 
West Hills
, while the flatter east side extends for roughly 180 blocks until it meets the suburb of 
Gresham
. In 1891 the cities of Portland, 
Albina
, and 
East Portland
 were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of street names and addresses. It was not unusual for a street name to be duplicated in disparate areas. The "Great Renumbering" on September 2, 1931, standardized street naming patterns and divided Portland into five "general districts". It also changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block and adopted a single street name on a grid. For example, the 200 block north of Burnside is either NW Davis Street or NE Davis Street throughout the entire city.

The six previous addressing sections of Portland, which were colloquially known as quadrants despite there being six,
[
106
]
[
107
]
 have developed distinctive identities, with mild cultural differences and friendly rivalries between their residents, especially between those who live east of the Willamette River versus west of the river.
[
108
]
 Portland's addressing sections are North, Northwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, and Southwest (which includes 
downtown Portland
). The Willamette River divides the city into east and west while 
Burnside Street
, which traverses the entire city lengthwise, divides the north and south. North Portland consists of the peninsula formed by the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, with N Williams Ave serving as its eastern boundary. All addresses and streets within the city are prefixed by N, NW, NE, S, SW or SE with the exception of Burnside Street, which is prefixed with W or E. Starting on May 1, 2020, former Southwest prefix addresses with house numbers on east–west streets leading with zero dropped the zero and the street prefix on all streets (including north–south streets) converted from Southwest to South. For example, the current address of 246 S California St. was changed from 0246 SW California St. and the current address of 4310 S Macadam Ave. was converted from 4310 SW Macadam Ave.

The new South Portland addressing section was approved by the Portland City Council on June 6, 2018
[
109
]
 and is bounded by 
SW Naito Parkway
, SW View Point Terrace and the 
Tryon Creek State Natural Area
 to the west, SW Clay Street to the north, the Willamette River to the east, and city limits to the south. It includes the Lair Hill, Johns Landing and South Waterfront districts and Lewis & Clark College as well as the Riverdale area of unincorporated Multnomah County south of the Portland city limits.
[
110
]
 In 2018, the city's Bureau of Transportation finalized a plan to transition this part of Portland into South Portland, beginning on May 1, 2020, to reduce confusion by 9-1-1 dispatchers and delivery services.
[
111
]
 With the addition of South Portland, all six addressing sectors (N, NE, NW, S, SE and SW) are now officially known as sextants.
[
112
]




Pearl District (left) from the Steel Bridge


The Pearl District
 in 
Northwest Portland
, which was largely occupied by warehouses, light industry and railroad classification yards in the early to mid-20th century, now houses upscale 
art galleries
, restaurants, and retail stores, and is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city.
[
113
]
 Areas further west of the Pearl District include neighborhoods known as Uptown and Nob Hill, as well as the Alphabet District and NW 23rd Ave., a major shopping street lined with clothing boutiques and other upscale retail, mixed with cafes and restaurants.
[
114
]




Lloyd District from downtown Portland


Northeast Portland is home to the 
Lloyd District
, 
Alberta Arts District
, and the 
Hollywood District
. North Portland is largely residential and industrial. It contains 
Kelley Point Park
, the northernmost point of the city. It also contains the 
St. Johns
 neighborhood, which is historically one of the most ethnically diverse and poorest neighborhoods in the city.
[
115
]


Old Town Chinatown
 is next to the Pearl District in Northwest Portland. In 1890 it was the second largest Chinese community in the United States.
[
116
]
 In 2017, the crime rate was several times above the city average. This neighborhood has been called Portland's skid row.
[
117
]
 Southwest Portland is largely residential. 
Downtown district
, made up of commercial businesses, museums, 
skyscrapers
, and public landmarks represents a small area within the southwest address section. Portland's South Waterfront area has been developing into a dense neighborhood of shops, condominiums, and apartments starting in the mid-2000s. Development in this area is ongoing.
[
118
]
 The area is served by the 
Portland Streetcar
, the 
MAX Orange Line
 and four 
TriMet
 bus lines. This former industrial area sat as a 
brownfield
 prior to development in the mid-2000s.
[
119
]


Southeast Portland is largely residential, and consists of several neighborhoods, including 
Hawthorne District
, 
Belmont
, 
Brooklyn
, and 
Mount Tabor
. 
Reed College
, a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1908, is located within the confines of Southeast Portland as is 
Mount Tabor
, a volcanic landform.

 During the war-time 
Liberty Ship
 construction boom, the need for workers drew many Black people to the city. The new influx of Black people settled in specific neighborhoods, such as the 
Albina
 district and 
Vanport
. The May 1948 flood which destroyed Vanport eliminated the only integrated neighborhood, and an influx of blacks into the northeast quadrant of the city continued.
[

 Portland's 
longshoremen
 racial mix was described as being "lily-white" in the 1960s when the local 
International Longshore and Warehouse Union
 declined to represent grain handlers since some were black.

List of parks in Portland, Oregon


Forest Park
 is the largest wilderness park in the United States that is within city limits


Parks and greenspace planning date back to 
John Charles Olmsted
's 1903 
Report to the Portland Park Board
. In 1995, voters in the Portland metropolitan region passed a regional bond measure to acquire valuable natural areas for fish, wildlife, and people.
[
255
]
 Ten years later, more than 8,100 acres (33 km
2
) of ecologically valuable natural areas had been purchased and permanently protected from development.

Portland is one of only four cities in the U.S. with extinct volcanoes within its boundaries (along with 
Pilot Butte
 in 
Bend, Oregon
, 
Jackson Volcano
 in 
Jackson, Mississippi
, and 
Diamond Head
 in 
Honolulu
, Hawaii). 
Mount Tabor Park
 is known for its scenic views and historic reservoirs.
[
257
]


Forest Park
 is the largest wilderness park within city limits in the United States, covering more than 5,000 acres (2,023 ha).
[
258
]
 Portland is also home to 
Mill Ends Park
, the world's smallest park (a two-foot-diameter circle, the park's area is only about 0.3 m
2
). 
Washington Park
 is just west of downtown and is home to the 
Oregon Zoo
, 
Hoyt Arboretum
, the 
Portland Japanese Garden
, and the 
International Rose Test Garden
. Portland is also home to 
Lan Su Chinese Garden
 (formerly the Portland Classical Chinese Garden), an authentic representation of a 
Suzhou
-style walled garden. Portland's east side has several formal public gardens: the historic 
Peninsula Park
 Rose Garden, the rose gardens of 
Ladd's Addition
, the 
Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden
, the 
Leach Botanical Garden
, and 
The Grotto
.

Portland's downtown features two groups of contiguous city blocks dedicated for park space: the 
North
 and 
South Park Blocks
.
[

[
260
]
 The 37-acre (15 ha) 
Tom McCall Waterfront Park
 was built in 1974 along the length of the downtown waterfront after 
Harbor Drive
 was removed; it now hosts large events throughout the year.
[
261
]
 The nearby historically significant 
Burnside Skatepark
 and five indoor 
skateparks
 give Portland a reputation as possibly "the most skateboard-friendly town in America."
[

Tryon Creek State Natural Area
 is one of three 
Oregon State Parks
 in Portland and the most popular; its creek has a run of 
steelhead
. The other two State Parks are 
Willamette Stone State Heritage Site
, in the West Hills, and the 
Government Island State Recreation Area
 in the Columbia River near 
Portland International Airport
.

In February 2015, the City Council approved a total ban on smoking in all city parks and natural areas effective July 1, 2015. The ban includes cigarettes, vaping, as well as marijuana.

Portland City Council (Oregon)


Since January 1, 2025, the city of Portland is governed by a 
mayor–council government
 system. Elected officials include the 
mayor
, a 12-member city council, and a city auditor. The city council is responsible for legislative policy, while the mayor appoints a professional 
city manager
 who oversees the various bureaus and day-to-day operations of the city. The mayor is elected 
at-large
, while the council is elected in four geographic districts using 
single transferable vote
, with 3 winning candidates per district. Portland's current form of government was approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure, with the 
first elections
 under the new system 
held in 2024
.
[
264
]


The 
Portland Office of Community and Civic Life
 (formerly Office of Neighborhood Involvement)
[
265
]
 serves as a conduit between city government and Portland's 
95 officially recognized neighborhoods
. Each neighborhood is represented by a volunteer-based 
neighborhood association
 which serves as a liaison between residents of the neighborhood and the city government. The city provides funding to neighborhood associations through seven district coalitions, each of which is a geographical grouping of several neighborhood associations. Most (but not all) neighborhood associations belong to one of these district coalitions.

Portland and its surrounding metropolitan area are served by 
Metro
, the United States' only directly elected 
metropolitan planning organization
. Metro's charter gives it responsibility for 
land use
 and 
transportation planning
, 
solid waste management
, and map development.

The 
Multnomah County
 government provides many services to the Portland area, as do 
Washington
 and 
Clackamas
 counties to the west and south.

Fire and emergency services are provided by 
Portland Fire & Rescue
.



Courts and law enforcement
[

Law enforcement is primarily provided by the 
Portland Police Bureau
 (PPB). The 
Multnomah County Sheriff's Office
 (MCSO) provides law enforcement on the city's 
transit system
 through their Transit Police division which is supplemented from officers from all local law enforcement agencies that fall within 
the transit authority's
 boundaries.

State and national politics
[
edit
]


Portland strongly favors the 
Democratic Party
; registered Democrats (51.2%) outnumber 
Republicans
 (10.5%) nearly 5 to 1. All city offices are 
non-partisan
.
[
268
]
 However, almost all of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. 
Fred L. Peterson
 in 1952 is the city's last elected Republican mayor, and no Republican has served as mayor even on an interim basis since 
Connie McCready
 held the post from 1979 to 1980.

Portland is split among three of Oregon's U.S. 
congressional districts
. Most of the city is in the 
3rd District
, represented by 
Maxine Dexter
 (D-Portland). Most of the city west of the Willamette River is part of the 
1st District
, represented by 
Suzanne Bonamici
 (D-Beaverton). A small portion of southeastern Portland is in the 
5th District
, currently represented by Democrat 
Janelle Bynum
. 
Lori Chavez-DeRemer
 was the first 
Republican
 to represent a significant portion of the city in the 
U.S. House of Representatives
 since 1975, from 2023 to 2025. Both of Oregon's senators, 
Ron Wyden
 and 
Jeff Merkley
, are progressive Democrats from Portland.

In the 
2008 presidential election
, Democratic candidate 
Barack Obama
 easily carried Portland, winning 245,464 votes from city residents to 50,614 for his 
Republican
 rival, 
John McCain
. In the 
2012 presidential election
, Democratic candidate 
Barack Obama
 again easily carried Portland, winning 256,925 votes from Multnomah county residents to 70,958 for his 
Republican
 rival, 
Mitt Romney
.
[

Sam Adams
, the former mayor of Portland, became the city's first openly gay mayor in 2009.
[
270
]
 In 2004, 59.7 percent of Multnomah County voters cast ballots against 
Oregon Ballot Measure 36
, which amended the 
Oregon Constitution
 to prohibit recognition of 
same-sex marriages
. The measure passed with 56.6% of the statewide vote. Multnomah County is one of two counties where a majority voted against the initiative; the other is 
Benton County
, which includes 
Corvallis
, home of 
Oregon State University
.
[

City planning and development
[
edit

Video of Portland's urban growth boundary. The red dots indicate areas of growth between 1986 and 1996.


The city consulted with urban planners as far back as 1904, resulting in the development of 
Washington Park
 and the 
40-Mile Loop
 greenway, which connects many of the city's parks.
[
276
]
 Portland is often cited as an example of a city with strong 
land use planning
 controls.
[
277
]
 This is largely the result of statewide land conservation policies adopted in 1973 under Governor 
Tom McCall
, in particular the requirement for an 
urban growth boundary
 (UGB) for every city and metropolitan area. The opposite extreme, a city with few or no controls, is typically illustrated by 
Houston
.

1966 photo shows sawdust-fired power plant on the edge of downtown that was removed to make way for dense residential development. High rises to left in background were early projects of the Portland Development Commission


Oregon's 1973 "
urban growth boundary
" law limits the boundaries for large-scale development in each metropolitan area in Oregon.
[
282
]
 This limits access to utilities such as sewage, water and telecommunications, as well as coverage by fire, police and schools.
[
282
]
 Portland's urban growth boundary, adopted in 1979, separates urban areas (where high-density development is encouraged and focused) from traditional farm land (where restrictions on non-agricultural development are very strict).
[
283
]
 This was atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along 
interstate highways
, in suburbs, and 
satellite cities
.

The original state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries, but critics felt this was not being accomplished. In 1995, the State passed a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land for a 20-year supply of future housing at projected growth levels.
[
284
]
 In 2007, the legislature changed the law to require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary, as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands.
[
146
]
 The growth boundary, along with efforts of the Portland Development Commission to create economic development zones, has led to the development of a large portion of downtown, a large number of mid- and high-rise developments, and an overall increase in housing and business density.
[
285
]


Prosper Portland
 (formerly the Portland Development Commission) is a semi-public agency that plays a major role in downtown development; city voters created it in 1958 to serve as the city's 
urban renewal
 agency. It provides housing and economic development programs within the city and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create large projects. In the early 1960s, the Portland Development Commission led the razing of a large Italian-Jewish neighborhood downtown, bounded roughly by I-405, the Willamette River, 4th Avenue and Market street.
[
286
]
 Mayor 
Neil Goldschmidt
 took office in 1972 as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5 pm. The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of new housing units clustered in three areas: north of Portland State University (between I-405, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside St., NW Northrup St., and NW 9th Ave.).

Historically, 
environmental consciousness
 has weighed significantly in the city's planning and development efforts.
[
287
]
 Portland was one of the first cities in the United States to promote and integrate alternative forms of transportation, such as the 
MAX Light Rail
 and extensive bike paths.
[
287
]
 The Urban Greenspaces Institute, housed in 
Portland State University
 Geography Department's Center for Mapping Research, promotes better integration of the built and natural environments. The institute works on urban park, trail, and natural areas planning issues, both at the local and regional levels.
[
288
]
 In October 2009, the Portland City Council unanimously adopted a 
climate action
 plan that will cut the city's greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.
[
289
]


As of 2012, Portland was the largest city in the United States that did not add 
fluoride
 to its public water supply,
[
290
]
 and 
fluoridation
 has historically been a subject of 
controversy
 in the city.
[
291
]
 Portland voters have four times voted against fluoridation, in 1956, 1962, 1980 (repealing a 1978 vote in favor), and 2013.
[
292
]
 In 2012 the city council, responding to advocacy from public health organizations and others, voted unanimously to begin fluoridation by 2014. Fluoridation opponents forced a public vote on the issue,
[
293
]
 and on May 21, 2013, city voters again rejected fluoridation.

Transportation
[

Main article: 
Transportation in Portland, Oregon


MAX Light Rail
 is the centerpiece of the city's public transportation system.
Portland Streetcar
 is a three-line system serving 
downtown
 and nearby areas.


The Portland metropolitan area has transportation services common to major U.S. cities, though Oregon's emphasis on proactive 
land-use planning
 and 
transit-oriented development
 within the 
urban growth boundary
 means commuters have multiple well-developed options.

In 2008, 12.6% of all commutes in Portland were on public transit.
[
307
]
 
TriMet
 operates most of the region's buses and the 
MAX
 (short for Metropolitan Area Express) 
light rail
 system, which connects the city and suburbs. Opened in 1986, the MAX system has expanded to five lines, with the latest being the 
Orange Line
 to 
Milwaukie
, which began operating in September 2015.
[
308
]
 
WES Commuter Rail
 opened in February 2009 in Portland's western suburbs, linking 
Beaverton
 and 
Wilsonville
.

The city-owned 
Portland Streetcar
 serves two routes in the Central City – 
downtown
 and adjacent districts. The first line, which opened in 2001 and was extended in 2005–07, operates from the South Waterfront District through Portland State University and north through the West End of downtown, to shopping areas and dense residential districts north and northwest of downtown. The second line that opened in 2012 added 3.3 miles (5.3 km) of tracks on the east side of the Willamette River and across the 
Broadway Bridge
 to a connection with the original line.
[
309
]
 The east-side line completed a loop to the tracks on the west side of the river upon completion of the new 
Tilikum Crossing
 in 2015,
[
310
]
 and, in anticipation of that, had been named the Central Loop line in 2012. However, it was renamed the 
Loop Service
, with an A Loop (clockwise) and B Loop (counterclockwise), when it became a complete loop with the opening of the Tilikum Crossing bridge.

Fifth and Sixth avenues within downtown comprise the 
Portland Transit Mall
, two streets devoted primarily to bus and light rail traffic with limited automobile access. Opened in 1977 for buses, the transit mall was renovated and rebuilt in 2007–09, with light rail added. Starting in 1975 and lasting nearly four decades, all transit service within downtown Portland was free, the area being known by TriMet as 
Fareless Square
, but a need for minor budget cuts and funding needed for expansion prompted the agency to limit free rides to rail service only in 2010,
[
311
]
 and subsequently to discontinue the fare-free zone entirely in 2012.
[
312
]


TriMet provides real-time tracking of buses and trains with its TransitTracker, and makes the data available to software developers so they can create customized tools of their own.
