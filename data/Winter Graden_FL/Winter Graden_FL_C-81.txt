Winter Garden is a city west of Downtown Orlando in the western part of Orange County, Florida, United States. Established by Henry Harrel of Alachua in 1857, it was formerly called Beulah. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its population was 46,051 as of 2019.

### History### Early Native History

The pre-European history of the modern Winter Garden area is ambiguous. Due a to lack of evidence historians hesitate to conclude if the natives that once occupied the area that is now Orange County were members of the Timucua, Jororo, or Mayaca tribes. Regardless of their tribal identity, these natives were either wiped out or subsumed into larger cultures by the end of the eighteenth century.

### Seminole Peoples and War

Following the eradication of the original Floridian cultures, natives from farther north migrated into Florida. The cultures of these natives coalesced into the Seminole Tribe. An 18th or 19th century Seminole presence in the Lake Apopka area is possible, with a significant Seminole leader, Wild Cat, possibly being born around the lake. The Second Seminole War and Third Seminole War both pushed the Seminole tribe south, likely eliminating their presence in the boundaries of modern Winter Garden.

### American Settlers

The first American settlers came to what is now Winter Garden in the 1850's. The Roper, Reams, Dunaway, Speer, and Starke families were among the first to settle the area. Some of the settler families owned slaves during the very early years of settlement. Initially the town engaged in vegetable and sugar cane farming. Although, during The Civil War the families were unable to sell their product and so had to subsist off of their own produce. The town grew over the remaining decades of the 19th century, officially incorporating in 1908.

### Citrus

In the last few decades of the 19th century, citrus growing saw rapid growth in the state of Florida, including in Winter Garden. As with the rest of Florida, the Great Freeze of 1894-1895 severely damaged the citrus industry of Winter Garden. However, the industry was able to recover and saw many decades of growth. In the 1980s back to back freezes dealt near fatal blows, greatly reducing the profitability of citrus farming in the county. The center of citrus production in recent decades has shifted south from central Florida. The increasing development of the Orlando Metropolitan Area made it more profitable to sell grove lands to developers rather than attempt to restart them. Today, very little citrus activity occurs in the city limits of Winter Garden.

### Fishing

Between the 1920s and 1960s, Lake Apopka drew countless fishermen to Winter Garden. The proximity of the town to the lake encouraged the growth of a fishing tourism industry. It was due to this fishing boom that the Edgewater Hotel in Downtown Winter Garden opened. However, by the 1960s, heavy pollution made Lake Apopka unappealing to fishermen. This, unsurprisingly, led to the collapse of the fishing tourism industry of the city.

### Climate

One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from May until October (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is a cooler season (November through March) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer, and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the Gulf Stream.

To the south, Winter Garden Village provides an array of chain retail and dining establishments. The open-air shopping center, located along Daniels Road just north of SR 429, is anchored by a Super Target, a Best Buy, Sprint and a Lowe's.

Downtown Winter Garden hosts a farmer's market every weekend from 9:00am–2:00pm. Many vendors sell fresh produce, plants and flowers, herbs, baked goods, artisan crafts, and local food and beverages. Live music is also a key feature at the market.

### Infrastructure### Transportation

State Road 50 (W. Colonial Dr) bisects the city into northern and southern sections. The portion south of State Road 50, formerly occupied by orange groves and farmland, has recently been the site of the development of numerous large-scale communities, including Johns Lake Pointe, Stoneybrook West, Stonecrest, Westfield, and Wintermere Pointe.

The toll road Western Beltway (SR 429) was completed in late 2006 and links I-4 near mile marker 58 in Osceola County with Florida's Turnpike at Winter Garden. Other major roads through Winter Garden include County Road 535 and County Road 545. CR 535 (also called Winter Garden – Vineland Road) begins at SR 50 and bisects the southern half of the city, proceeding south to Windermere, Lake Buena Vista and Walt Disney World Resort, where it becomes State Road 535. CR 545 (also called Avalon Road) begins at SR 50 and proceeds south along the western edge of Winter Garden and along the border between Orange and Lake counties. This area remains mostly rural but is quickly developing because of the nearby toll road. CR 545 currently ends at US 192 in Kissimmee at the border to Osceola County.
