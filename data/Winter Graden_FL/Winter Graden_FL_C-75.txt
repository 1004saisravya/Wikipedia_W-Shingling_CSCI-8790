Winter Garden is a city west of Downtown Orlando in the western part of Orange County, Florida, United States. Established by Henry Harrel of Alachua in 1857, it was formerly called Beulah. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its population was 46,051 as of 2019.

### History### Early Native History

The pre-European history of the modern Winter Garden area is ambiguous. Due to a lack of evidence historians hesitate to conclude if the natives that once occupied the area were of the Timucua, Jororo, or Mayaca tribes. Regardless of their tribal identity, these natives were either wiped out or subsumed into larger cultures by the end of the eighteenth century.

### Seminole Peoples and War

Following the eradication of the original Floridian cultures, natives from farther north migrated into Florida. The cultures of these natives coalesced into the Seminole Tribe. An 18th or 19th century Seminole presence in the Lake Apopka area is possible, with a significant Seminole leader, Wild Cat, possibly being born around the lake. The Second Seminole War and Third Seminole War both pushed the Seminole tribe south, likely eliminating their presence in the boundaries of modern Winter Garden.

### American Settlers

The first American settlers came to what is now Winter Garden in the 1850s. The Roper, Reams, Dunaway, Speer, and Starke families were among the first to settle the area. As with most American pioneers, they engaged in agriculture as a primary economic activity. These farms mainly grew sugar cane and vegetables, and early on a small number utilized slave labor. During The Civil War steamboat traffic stopped along the St. Johns River, forcing Winter Garden families to subsist off their own crops.

The arrival of the Orange Belt Railroad and the growing production of citrus, turpentine, and lumber drove the town's growth over the remaining decades of the 19th century and into the 20th. Stores and businesses cropped up along Plant Street, originating Downtown Winter Garden. A settler from Mississippi named A. B. Newton greatly contributed to the town's growth. He opened one of the first stores, served as the first postmaster, founded the first newspaper, and functioned as the first mayor. These endeavors earned him the title "The Godfather of Winter Garden."

### Fishing

Between the 1920s and 1960s, the fishing prospects of Lake Apopka drew many fishermen to Winter Garden. It was due to this fishing boom that the Edgewater Hotel, which operates today, in Downtown Winter Garden opened. However, by the 1960s, heavy pollution of Lake Apopka resulted in the collapse of the industry.

### Citrus

In the last few decades of the 19th century, citrus saw rapid growth in the state of Florida, including in Winter Garden. As with the rest of the state, the Great Freeze of 1894–1895 severely damaged the citrus industry in Winter Garden. Many settlers left Winter Garden following this disaster, leaving a smaller population to recover the area's farms. Despite this setback, the industry recovered and saw many decades of growth. Through the middle stretch of the 20th century citrus defined Winter Garden's economy and culture.

In the 1980s back-to-back freezes greatly reduced the profitability of citrus farming in the county. Citrus production in Winter Garden and Orange County never recovered. Since then, the center of citrus production in Florida has shifted south from Orange County. The increasing development of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Area made it more profitable to sell grove lands to developers rather than attempt to restart them. Today, little citrus activity occurs in the city limits of Winter Garden.

### 21st Century Growth

Since 2000, Winter Garden has seen incredible growth despite the decline of citrus and the economic stagnation in the 1990s. Entrepreneurs rejuvenated the downtown district, attracting locals and tourists with a mix of small town atmosphere and trendy businesses. This population and development growth endured through the Great Recession and continues today.

To the south, Winter Garden Village provides an array of chain retail and dining establishments. The open-air shopping center, located along Daniels Road just north of SR 429, is anchored by a Super Target, a Best Buy, Sprint and a Lowe's.

Downtown Winter Garden hosts a farmer's market every weekend from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm. Many vendors sell fresh produce, plants and flowers, herbs, baked goods, artisan crafts, and local food and beverages. Live music is also a key feature at the market.

### Infrastructure### Transportation

State Road 50 (W. Colonial Dr) bisects the city into northern and southern sections. The portion south of State Road 50, formerly occupied by orange groves and farmland, has recently been the site of the development of numerous large-scale communities, including Johns Lake Pointe, Stoneybrook West, Stonecrest, Westfield, and Wintermere Pointe.

The toll road Western Beltway (SR 429) was completed in late 2006 and links I-4 near mile marker 58 in Osceola County with Florida's Turnpike at Winter Garden. Other major roads through Winter Garden include County Road 535 and County Road 545. CR 535 (also called Winter Garden – Vineland Road) begins at SR 50 and bisects the southern half of the city, proceeding south to Windermere, Lake Buena Vista and Walt Disney World Resort, where it becomes State Road 535. CR 545 (also called Avalon Road) begins at SR 50 and proceeds south along the western edge of Winter Garden and along the border between Orange and Lake counties. This area remains mostly rural but is quickly developing because of the nearby toll road. CR 545 currently ends at US 192 in Kissimmee at the border to Osceola County.
