### History
In the early 19th century, the Johns Creek area was dotted with trading posts along theChattahoochee Riverin what was thenCherokeeterritory. The Cherokee nation at the time was a confederacy of agrarian villages led by a chief. However, after Europeans colonized the area, the Cherokee developed an alphabet, and a legislature and judiciary system patterned after the American model.
Some trading posts gradually became crossroads communities where pioneer families – Rogers, McGinnis, Findley, Buice, Cowart, Medlock and others – gathered to visit and sell their crops.
By 1820, the community of Sheltonville (now known as Shakerag) was a ferry crossing site, with the McGinnis Ferry and Rogers Ferry carrying people and livestock across the river for a small fee. Further south, the Nesbit Ferry did the same near another crossroads community known as Newtown.
In the 1820s, the discovery of gold in the foothills of northeast Georgia within the Cherokee Nation – approximately 45 miles (72 km) north of today's Johns Creek – led to America's first Gold Rush, the eventual takeover of the Cherokee Nation by the U.S. government in 1830, and the subsequent forced exile (the "Trail of Tears") of Cherokee Indians toOklahomaand other areas of the American West.
A few Cherokees remained, the most famous being Sarah Cordery (1785–1842), the half-blood Cherokee wife of pioneer John Rogers (1774–1851), and their 12 children. Rogers was a respected, influential plantation owner and colleague of PresidentAndrew Jackson. Rogers's 1828 home – today, a private residence in Johns Creek – was an overnight stop-over for Jackson. Much later, the home was also visited by famed humoristWill Rogers, the great, great-nephew of John Rogers. Johns Creek's name comes from John Rogers's son, Johnson K. Rogers.A local tributarywas named after him, and the name "Johns Creek" eventually came to be the name of the area.
In 1831, much of the land in the former Cherokee Nation north of the Chattahoochee was combined into the massive Cherokee County. WhenMilton Countywas formed in 1858, the Johns Creek area was folded into it.
In the 1930s, during theGreat Depression, Milton County was dissolved and all of its land was then absorbed into Fulton County.
The four main crossroad communities — Ocee, Newtown, Shakerag and Warsaw — remained the social, educational and business centers of rural, unincorporated northeast Fulton County. For the next 50 years, these communities helped bring a sense of identity to this largely undeveloped and underpopulated area, as the nearby cities ofRoswell,Alpharetta,DuluthandSuwaneeand adjoiningForsythandGwinnettcounties continued to grow and develop.
In 1981, a group ofGeorgia Institute of Technologygraduates bought 1,700 acres (6.9 km2) of farmland and woods near McGinnis Ferry and Medlock Bridge Roads for a high-tech office park. The new office park was to mirror one built in 1970 in nearbyPeachtree Corners, known as Technology Park/Atlanta. Spotting tiny Johns Creek on an old map, they named their mixed-use, master-planned community "Technology Park/Johns Creek". This is the first reference to Johns Creek as a place. The area grew over the years to become the home of 200 companies – many of them Fortune 500 firms – with nearly 11,000 people spread over 6,000,000 square feet (560,000 m2) of office, retail and industrial space. With the jobs came houses and shopping centers, and the population increased to about 60,000.
By 2000, a grassroots movement to incorporate the Johns Creek area into a city was slowly developing. Residents wanted more control over issues such as traffic, growth, development and quality of life. They also sought a level of service that was a challenge for thesprawlingFulton County to provide. Following the nearby city ofSandy Springs’ successful incorporation in 2005, a legislative campaign was started to incorporate the Johns Creek community. House Bill 1321 was passed by the state legislature, signed by Gov. Sonny Perdue in March 2006, and approved by the residents of northeast Fulton County in a July 18, 2006 voter referendum.[6]In November 2006, the city's first elected officials were voted into office, with the City of Johns Creek becoming official December 1, 2006.
In 2017, an iHeartJC initiative has been growing to have the city's residential, business and innovation ecosystem develop a long-term strength and identity in healthcare innovation and wellness.[7]

### Infrastructure


### Transportation
Johns Creek is not directly served byMARTAtrains or buses.GRTA XpressRoute 408 connects Johns Creek with theDoraville MARTA station.[21]
In January 2018 significant plans were approved for the engineering phase to upgrade State Bridge Road and Pleasant Hill Road.[22]There is community-wide support from the community in both neighboring Johns Creek and Duluth for thepedestrian river bridgefor the project. It will serve to improve bike pedestrian safety, boost local economies by improving access to businesses, enhance connections with surrounding neighborhoods and improve traffic flow in the area. In addition, the upgrade will serve to ease inspection and maintenance of the bridge in the future.
In March 2018, the Gwinnett County Commissioners approved the agreement with the Johns Creek City Council.[23][24]Both sides have agreed to remove the sidewalks from the existing bridges in order to widen the roads. To improve safety for pedestrians, a new pedestrian bridge will be constructed on one side of the river. Apedestrian underpasslinking both sides of the wider road is being considered to further improve access and provide for a safer crossing of the road.
The Rogers bridge project is another significant plan is to connect toDuluthvia reconstructing a bike/pedestrian bridge across the Chattahoochee River. The engineers will determine whether to replace or rehabilitate the existing Rogers Bridge over the Chattahoochee River, will take into account the environmental impacts of each option, and will restore the working bike/pedestrian connection between Duluth and Johns Creek. This will allow access to the planned 133 acre parkland under development in Johns Creek, and will allow Fulton County residents access toRogers Bridge Park, the Chattapoochee Dog Park, and theWestern Gwinnett Bikewaycurrently under development by Gwinnett County.[25]
