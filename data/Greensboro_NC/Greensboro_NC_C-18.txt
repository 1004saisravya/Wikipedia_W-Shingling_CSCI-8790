), also known as the "San Juan of the Land" and "Chicago of the Piedmont", is a city in 
Guilford County, North Carolina
, United States, and its 
county seat
. Its population was 299,035 at the 
2020 census

 It is the most populous city in North Carolina's 
Piedmont Triad
 region, home to about 1.7 million residents.

In 1808, Greensboro was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed 
Guilford Court House
 as the county seat. The county courts were thus placed closer to the county's geographical center, a location more easily reached at the time by the majority of the county's citizens, who traveled by horse or on foot.

History

Timeline of Greensboro, North Carolina


Early history
[
edit
]


Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the inhabitants of the area that became Greensboro were the Saura, a 
Siouan
-speaking people.
[
28
]
: 7 
 Other indigenous cultures had occupied this area for thousands of years, typically settling along the waterways, as did the early settlers.

Quaker
 migrants from Pennsylvania, by way of 
Maryland
, arrived at Capefair (now Greensboro) in about 1750. The new settlers began organized religious services affiliated with the 
Cane Creek Friends Meeting
 in 
Snow Camp
 in 1751.
[
29
]
 Three years later, 40 Quaker families were granted approval to establish New Garden Monthly Meeting.
[
29
]
 The action is recorded in the minutes of the 
Perquimans
 and Little River Quarterly Meeting on May 25, 1754: "To Friends at New Garden in Capefair", signed by Joseph Ratliff.
[
30
]
 The settlement grew rapidly over the next three years, adding members from as far away as 
Nantucket
, Massachusetts.
[
29
]
 It soon became North Carolina's most important Quaker community and the mother of several other Quaker meetings established in the state and west of the 
Appalachians
.
[
29
]


After the 
Revolutionary War
, the city of Greensboro was named for Major General 
Nathanael Greene
, commander of the rebel American forces at the 
Battle of Guilford Court House
 on March 15, 1781.
[
28
]
: 20 
 Although the Americans lost the battle, Greene's forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British Army of General 
Cornwallis
. After the battle, Cornwallis withdrew his troops to a British coastal base in 
Wilmington
.
[
31
]
[
32
]




The 
Battle of Guilford Courthouse


Greensboro was established near the geographic center of Guilford County, on land that was "an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of 
huckleberry
 bushes, that bore a finely flavored fruit."
[
33
]
 Property for the future village was purchased from the Saura for $98. Three north–south streets (Greene, Elm, Davie) were laid out intersecting with three east–west streets, Gaston, Market, and Sycamore.
[
28
]
: 171–174, 21 
 The courthouse was built at the center of the intersection of Elm and Market streets. By 1821, the town was home to 369 residents.



Blandwood Mansion
, by Alexander Jackson Davis


In the early 1840s, the state government designated Greensboro as one of the stops on a new railroad line, at the request of Governor 
John Motley Morehead
, whose house, 
Blandwood
, was in Greensboro. Stimulated by rail traffic and improved access to markets, the city grew substantially, soon becoming known as the "Gate City" due to its role as a transportation hub for the Piedmont.
[
34
]
: 66 
 The railroads transported goods to and from the cotton 
textile
 mills. Many of the manufacturers developed workers' housing in mill villages near their facilities.

Though the city developed slowly, early wealth generated in the 18th and 19th centuries from cotton trade and merchandising resulted in owners' constructing several notable buildings. The earliest, later named 
Blandwood Mansion and Gardens
, was built by a farmer in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846, designed by 
Alexander Jackson Davis
, made the house influential as America's earliest 
Tuscan
-style villa. It has been designated a 
National Historic Landmark
.
[
35
]
 Other significant houses and estates were developed, including Dunleith, designed by 
Samuel Sloan
; Bellemeade; and the 
Bumpass-Troy House
. Since the late 20th century, the latter has been adapted and operates as a private inn.



Civil War and last days of the Confederacy
[
edit
]


In the mid-19th century, many of the residents of the Piedmont and western areas of the state were 
Unionist
, and Guilford County did not vote for 
secession
. But once North Carolina joined the 
Confederacy
, some citizens joined the Confederate cause, forming infantry units such as the Guilford Grays to fight in the 
American Civil War
. From 1861 to March 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the war, although residents had to deal with regional shortages of clothing, medicine, and other items caused by the US naval blockade of the South.

In the war's final weeks, Greensboro played a unique role in the last days of the Confederate government. In April 1865, the commanding officer of the Army of Tennessee, General 
Joseph E. Johnston
, instructed General 
P. G. T. Beauregard
 to prepare to defend the city. During this time, 
Confederate President
 
Jefferson Davis
 and the remaining members of the Confederate cabinet had evacuated the Confederate Capital in 
Richmond, Virginia
, and moved south to 
Danville, Virginia
.

When Union cavalry threatened Danville, Davis and his cabinet managed to escape by train, and reassembled in Greensboro on April 11, 1865. While in the city, Davis and his cabinet decided to try to split up and make their way 
west of the Mississippi River
 to continue the war effort and avoid capture. Shortly thereafter, the cabinet left Greensboro and separated. Greensboro is notable as the last place where the entire Confederate government met as a group; some consider it the Confederacy's final capital city.
[
36
]
: 101 


At nearly the same time, Governor 
Zebulon B. Vance
 fled 
Raleigh
, the capital of North Carolina, before the forces of Union General 
William Tecumseh Sherman
 swept the city.
[
37
]
 For a brief period beginning April 16, 1865, he and other officials maintained the state capital in Greensboro.
[
28
]
: 395 
[
38
]
: 177 
 Vance proclaimed the North Carolina Surrender Declaration on April 28, 1865.
[
38
]
: 182 
 Later, he surrendered to Union officials in the parlor of Blandwood Mansion. Historian Blackwell Robinson wrote, "Greensboro witnessed not only the demise of the Confederacy but also that of the old civil government of the state."
[
36
]
: 101 


Once surrender negotiations were completed at 
Bennett Place
 (in present-day 
Durham
) between General Johnston and General Sherman on April 26, 1865, Confederate soldiers in Greensboro stacked their arms, received their paroles, and headed home.



Industrialization and growth
[
edit
]


White Oak Mill in 1909


After the war, investors worked to restore the textile mills and related industry. In the 1890s, the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists, including Moses and Caesar Cone of 
Baltimore
.
[
28
]
: 171–174 
 The Cone brothers established large-scale textile plants, changing Greensboro from a village to a city within a decade. By 1900, Greensboro was considered a center of the Southern textile industry, with large-scale factories producing 
denim
, 
flannel
, and 
overalls
.
[
34
]
: 59 
 The resulting prosperity was expressed in the construction of notable 20th-century civic architecture, including the 
Guilford County Courthouse
, 
West Market Street United Methodist Church
 by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and the 
Julius I. Foust Building
 of the 
University of North Carolina at Greensboro
, designed by 
Orlo Epps
.

During the 20th century, Greensboro continued to increase in population and wealth. Grand commercial and civic buildings, many of which still stand today, were designed by local architects Charles Hartmann and Harry Barton. Other notable industries became established in the city, including 
Vicks Chemical Co.
 (known for over-the-counter cold remedies such as 
VapoRub
 and 
NyQuil
), Carolina Steel Corporation, and Pomona Terra Cotta Works.
[
36
]
: 220 
 During the first three decades, Greensboro grew so rapidly that there was an acute worker housing shortage. Builders set a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year to provide homes for workers.
[
36
]
: 209 
 Greensboro's real estate was considered "the wonder of the state" in the 1920s. Growth continued even through the 
Great Depression
, as Greensboro attracted an estimated 200 new families per year.
[
36
]
: 210 
 The city earned a reputation as a well-planned community with a strong emphasis on education, parks, and a profitable employment base.

Greensboro has two major public research universities, 
North Carolina A&T State University
, a 
historically black college
 established in the late 19th century, and the 
University of North Carolina at Greensboro
. During the height of the 
civil rights movement
 in the early 1960s, students from A&T were the major force in protests to achieve racial justice, desegregation of public facilities, and fair employment, beginning with the 
Greensboro Four
, who sat in at the segregated lunch counter at 
Woolworth's
 in 1960 to gain service. The largest civil rights protests in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro in May and June 1963. In the 21st century, the universities are leaders in new areas of research in high tech and science, on which the city hopes to build a new economy.

Wartime and postwar prosperity brought development, and designs commissioned from nationally and internationally known architects. 
Walter Gropius
, a leader of the German 
Bauhaus
 movement in the United States, designed a factory building in the city in 1944.
[
39
]
 Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein designed projects throughout the region. 
Eduardo Catalano
 and 
George Matsumoto
 were hired for projects whose designs have challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms.



Civil rights movement
[
edit

Main article: 
Greensboro sit-ins


In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Greensboro's population as 74.0% white and 25.8% black.
[
40
]
 As in the rest of the state, most blacks were still 
disenfranchised
 under state laws, 
Jim Crow laws
 and customs were in effect, and public facilities, including schools, were racially segregated by law. This was after the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in 
Brown v. Board of Education
 that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Facilities reserved for blacks were generally underfunded by the state and city governments, which were dominated by conservative white Democrats.

In the postwar period, blacks in North Carolina and across the South pushed to regain their constitutional rights. College students from 
North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College
 (A&T), a 
historically black college
, made Greensboro a center of protests and change. On February 1, 1960, 
four black college students
 sat down at an "all-white" 
Woolworth's
 
lunch counter
, and refused to leave after they were denied service. They had already purchased items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts. After being denied lunch service, they brought out the receipts, asking why their money was good everywhere else in the store but not at the lunch counter.
[
41
]
 Hundreds of supporters soon joined in this sit-in, which lasted several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the 
desegregation
 of lunch counters and other facilities at Woolworth's and other chains.

Woolworth's went out of business due to changes in 20th-century retail practices, but the original Woolworth's lunch counter and stools are still in their original location. The former Woolworth's building has been adapted as the 
International Civil Rights Center and Museum
, which opened on February 1, 2010, the 50th anniversary of the sit-ins.
[
42
]
 A section of the counter is on display at the 
Smithsonian
 in Washington, D.C. to mark the protesters' courage.
[
43
]




Former Woolworth's store, now the 
International Civil Rights Center and Museum


The white business community acceded to the desegregation of Woolworth's and made other minor concessions, but the civil rights movement had additional goals, holding protests in 1962 and 1963. In May and June 1963, the largest civil rights protest in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro. Protesters sought desegregation of public accommodations, and economic and social justice, such as hiring policies based on merit rather than race. They also worked for the overdue integration of public schools.

Each night more than 2,000 protesters marched through Greensboro's segregated central business district. William Thomas and A. Knighton Stanley, coordinators of Greensboro's local 
CORE
 chapter, invited 
Jesse Jackson
, then an activist student at A&T, to join the protests. Jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader, becoming the public spokesman of the non-violent protest movement. Seeking to overwhelm city jails, as was done in protests led by 
Martin Luther King Jr.
 in 
Birmingham, Alabama
, the protesters invited arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses; they were charged with 
trespassing
 and other nonviolent actions. College and high school students constituted most of the protesters, and at one point approximately 1,400 blacks were jailed in Greensboro. The scale of protests disrupted the business community and challenged the leadership of the mayor and Governor 
Terry Sanford
.

Finally, the city and business community responded with further desegregation of public facilities, reformed hiring policies in city government, and commitments to progress by both Sanford and Greensboro's mayor. Sanford declared, "Anyone who hasn't received this message doesn't understand human nature." Significant changes in race relations still came at a painfully slow pace, and the verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 were not implemented in substantial ways.

Dudley High School/A&T protests
[
edit
]


Main article: 
1969 Greensboro uprising


In May 1969, students of 
James B. Dudley High School
 were outraged when the administration refused to let a popular candidate, Claude Barnes, run for 
student union
 class president, allegedly due to his membership in Youth for the Unity of Black Society.
[
45
]
 After their appeals to the school were rejected, the students asked activists at North Carolina A&T State University for support in a protest.
[
46
]
[
47
]
[
48
]
 Protests escalated and after students at A&T had thrown rocks at police, they returned on May 21 armed with 
tear gas
 canisters, using them against the crowds. The 
uprising
 grew larger, and the governor ordered the National Guard to back up local police.

After there were exchanges of gunfire, the governor ordered the 
North Carolina National Guard
 into the A&T campus, in what was described at the time as "the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university".
[
49
]
 The North Carolina National Guard swept the college dormitories, taking hundreds of students into "protective custody". The demonstrations were suppressed. The North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the 
United States Commission on Civil Rights
 investigated the disturbances; its 1970 report concluded that the National Guard invasion was a reckless action disproportionate to the danger posed by student protests. It criticized local community leaders for failing to respond adequately to the Dudley High School students when the issues first arose. They declared it "a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&T State University".

Greensboro massacre


Greensboro massacre march


On November 3, 1979, members of what would become the 
Communist Workers Party (CWP)
 held an anti-
Ku Klux Klan
 rally at the Morningside Homes public housing project.
[
50
]
 Four local TV news stations covered it. During the protest, two cars containing Klansmen and neo-Nazis arrived.
[
51
]
 After a confrontation, the KKK and CWP groups exchanged gunfire. Five CWP members were killed. Eleven CWP members and one Klansman were injured.
[
52
]
 Television footage of the actions was shown worldwide, and the event became known as the 
Greensboro massacre
. In November 1980, six KKK defendants were acquitted in a state criminal trial by an all-white jury after a week of deliberation. Families of those killed and injured in the attack filed a civil suit against the city and police department for failure to protect citizens. In 1985, a jury in this case found five police officers and two other individuals liable for $350,000 in damages; the monies were to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund, established to advance civil rights.



21st century
[
edit
]


Textile companies and related businesses continue into the 21st century, when most went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies as textile manufacturing jobs moved offshore. Greensboro is still a major center of the textile industry, with the main offices of Elevate Textiles (Cone, Burlington Industries), 
Galey & Lord
, Unifi, and 
VF Corporation
 (
Wrangler
, Lee, Helly Hansen, Musto, and Rock & Republic), 
ITG Brands
, maker of Kool, Winston and Salem brand cigarettes and the nation's third-largest tobacco company is headquartered in Greensboro. 

Rail traffic continues to be important for the city's economy, as Greensboro is a major regional freight hub. Twelve 
Amtrak
 passenger trains also stop in Greensboro daily. The Crescent has its platform on the main 
Norfolk Southern
 line between 
Washington
 and 
New Orleans
 by way of 
Atlanta
. The 
Carolinian
 and 
Piedmont
 trains have their platform at the start of Norfolk Southern 
NC-Line
 that runs from Greensboro to Goldsboro, NC. The Norfolk Southern K-Line starts at the Pomona freight yard just west of downtown and runs towards Winston-Salem.  The Norfolk Southern CF-Line originally started in Mt. Airy, NC but rail has been removed north of downtown and now starts at the wye with the mainline downtown and heads south to Gulf, NC

In 1998, 
FedEx
 built a $300 million mid-Atlantic air-cargo and sorting hub at 
Piedmont Triad International Airport
, after an intensive competition for the hub among other regions of the state, as well as locations in 
South Carolina
. The project was challenged in court based on the quality of planned noise and pollution abatements from neighborhoods near the site. The hub opened in 2009. Originally projected by FedEx to employ 750 people in its first two years of operation and eventually 1,500, local FedEx employment has been nearly the same as before the facility was constructed.

Climate
[
edit
]


Like much of the 
southeastern United States
, Greensboro has a 
humid subtropical climate
 (
Köppen
 
Cfa
), with four distinct seasons. Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily average of 38.9 °F (3.8 °C). On average, there are 75 nights per year that drop to or below freezing,
[
a
]
 and 4.3 days that fail to rise above freezing.
[
78
]
[
b
]
 Measurable snowfall occurs nearly every winter, and accumulates to 7.5 inches (19.1 cm) on average, usually in January and February and occasionally December and March; the amount varies considerably from winter to winter.
[
c
]
 
Cold-air damming
 (CAD) can facilitate 
freezing rain
, often making it a more pressing concern than snow. Summers are hot and humid, with a daily average in July of 78.5 °F (25.8 °C). On average, 32 days per year have highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C), but, as in much of the 
Piedmont
 South, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are uncommon.
[
78
]
 Autumn is similar to spring in temperature but has fewer days of rainfall and less total rainfall. Extremes in temperature have ranged from −8 °F (−22 °C) on 
January 21, 1985
, to 104 °F (40 °C), on June 12, 1911, June 12, 1914, and July 17, 1914.

Thunderstorms are common during the humid spring and summer months, some severe. On April 2, 1936, around 7:00 pm, a large, F-4 tornado cut a seven-mile (11-km) swath of destruction through southern Greensboro. 14 people were killed and 144 injured by the tornado, which moved through part of downtown. The storm was part of the 
1936 Cordele-Greensboro tornado outbreak
.
[

 Strong tornadoes have struck the Greensboro area since then, notably 
Stoneville
 on 
March 20, 1998
; 
Clemmons
 and 
Winston-Salem
 on 
May 5, 1989
; 
Clemmons
 and Greensboro on 
May 7, 2008
;

 High Point on
