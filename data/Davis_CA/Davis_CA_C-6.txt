Davis
 is a city located in 
Yolo County, California
.  As of the local census, the city had a total population of 64,821 (60,308 in 2000).  Davis is well-known in the state of

 as being a socially and environmentally conscious university town.

History
[
edit
]

Davis grew around a 
Southern Pacific Railroad
 depot which was built in 1868. It was then known as "Davisville", named for 
Jerome C. Davis
, a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name to simply "Davis" in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated in March  1917.

From its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agriculture along with veterinary care and 
animal husbandry
. This has especially been true ever since the 
University of California
 decided to build a 
land grant
 university there in 1908. Now the city is also known for its contributions in the areas of 
biotechnology
, 
medicine
 and other 
life sciences
.

Bicycling
[
edit
]

Being flat, Davis is naturally a very good place for bicyclists. The town has taken advantage of that precursor, and when it expands, new bike paths are usually mandated by the city. As a result, Davis is covered in bike paths, and biking is one of the more common types of transportation, used especially by 
UC Davis
 students because of bicycling's relative inexpensiveness. Davis has been referred to as the "Most bicycle friendly town in the world", as most of the bike paths are in good repair, and one can get just about anywhere without leaving bike paths or bike lanes in streets.

Sights and Events
[
edit
]

Farmers Market
[
edit
]

Every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning, families and friends flock to the Central Park (on 4th and C street) in Davis to buy fresh produce, a healthy meal or baked goods at the 
Davis Farmers Market
.  Open rain or shine, this event allows the participation of independent farmers, non-profit organizations, craftsmens and local businesses represented in a communal atmosphere. 

The times for the year-round Saturday market are from 8:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. while the Wednesday market changes times with the season.  During the month of April to October runs the popular 
Picnic in the Park
 from 4:30-8:30 p.m. while during October through March the market is from 2:00-6:00 p.m. 

Available products include fruits and vegetables that are currently in season, baked goods, and dairy and meat products, often from certified organic farms.  With such a wide variety of produce and foods, many people can do the majority of their shopping here.  The available stands, shoppers and overall atmosphere greatly depend on each particular market.  For example 
Picnic in the Park
 is geared towards family attendance during dinner time because of the presence of a band and multiple restaurants.  Some of which include The Buckhorn, Katmandu and The Hotdogger.  While during the fall and winter months this market becomes smaller in size and geared mainly towards weekly shoppers.  The Saturday market includes some local restaurants along with a performing group, craft persons and various non-profit organizations.

More information of times, directions or becoming a market member can be found at their local website:

.  This website also includes a search for available products as well as a calendar filled with special events!

Toad Tunnel
[
edit
]

The Post Office is a great place to stay if you're a toad.

Davis' 
Toad
 Tunnel
 has drawn much attention over the years including a mention on 
The Daily Show
.  Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass.

The tunnel has created problems of its own.  The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lighted to encourage its use.  The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel.  The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Post-Master to resemble a toad town.

Whole Earth Festival
[
edit
]

The 
Whole Earth Festival
 
(WEF)
 is a three-day music and education festival in the Spring, which usually takes place during Mother's Day Weekend on UC Davis' main quadrangle.  It is considered by many to be a must-see Davis event.  Every year, thousands of environmentally conscious, politically active and/or music-loving people make the pilgrimage to Davis for this event, for which the UCD quad is filled with hundreds of craft booths, music acts, education booths, and food booths.

A continuous stream of bands, speakers and various workshops occurs throughout the weekend on each of WEF's three stages and other specialty areas. The majority of the festival is solar powered.

WEF is organized primarily by UC Davis students, in association with the Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD) and the university.
