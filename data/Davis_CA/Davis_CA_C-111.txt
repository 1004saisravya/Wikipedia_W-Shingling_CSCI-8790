History
[
edit
]

Davis grew around a 
Southern Pacific Railroad
 depot which was built in 
1868
. At that time it was known as "Davisville" (named for 
Jerome C. Davis
 - a prominent local farmer). However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name to simply "Davis" in 
1907
. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated in 
March
 of 
1917
.

From its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agriculture along with veterinary care and 
animal husbandry
. This has especially been true ever since the 
University of California
 decided to build a 
land grant
 university there in 
1908
. Now the city is also known for its contributions in the areas of 
biotechnology
, 
medicine
 and other 
life sciences
.

Toad Tunnel
[
edit
]

Davis' 
Toad
 Tunnel
 has drawn much attention over the years including a mention on 
The Daily Show
.  Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy,  a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass.

The tunnel has created problems of its own.  The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lighted to encourage its use.  The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel.  The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Post-Master to resemble a toad town.

Whole Earth Festival
[
edit

The 
Whole Earth Festival
 aka Hippie Day is a three day music and education festival in the Spring, which usually takes place during Mother's Day Weekend on UC Davis' main quadrangle.  It is considered by many to be a must-see Davis event.  Every year, thousands of environmentally conscious,  politically active and/or music-loving people make the pilgrimage to Davis for this event, for which the UCD quad is littered with hundreds of craft huts, music acts, massage tables and food booths. 

A continuous stream of bands, speakers and various workshops occurs throughout the weekend on each of WEF's three stages and other specialty areas.  

WEF is organized primarily by UC Davis students, in association with the Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD) and the university.
