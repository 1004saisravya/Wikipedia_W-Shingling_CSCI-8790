History
[
edit
]


For a chronological guide, see 
Timeline of Charlotte, North Carolina
.


Early history
[
edit
]


The city's namesake, 
Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz
, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, 
c.
 1779


The 
Catawba Indians
 were the first known historic tribe to settle Mecklenburg County in the Charlotte area and were first recorded around 1567, according to  Spanish records.



18th century
[
edit
]


By 1759, half the Catawba tribe had died from 
smallpox
, an endemic disease among European colonists, which the Catawba had no natural 
immunity
 against. At the time of their largest population, the Catawba population was 10,000. But by 1826, the Catawba population dropped to 110.
[
42
]


The city of Charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of 
Scots-Irish
 
Presbyterians
, or 
Ulster-Scot
 settlers from 
Ulster
, who dominated the culture of the Southern Piedmont Region and made up the principal founding population in the backcountry. 
German immigrants
 also settled in the area before the 
American Revolutionary War
, but in smaller numbers. They still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region.

Mecklenburg County was initially part of 
Bath County
 (1696 to 1729) of the New Hanover Precinct, which became 
New Hanover County
 in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into 
Bladen County
 in 1734, and its western portion split into 
Anson County
 in 1750. Mecklenburg County was formed from Anson County in 1762. Further apportionment was made in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War, with 
Cabarrus County
 formed from Mecklenburg.
[
43
]




19th century
[
edit
]


In 1842, 
Union County
 formed from Mecklenburg's southeastern portion and a western portion of Anson County. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the 
Salisbury District
.
[
44
]


The area that is now Charlotte was first settled by European colonists around 1755 when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. 
Thomas Polk
 (great-uncle of 
President
 
James K. Polk
), who later married Thomas Spratt's daughter, built his house by the intersection of two 
Native American
 trading paths between the 
Yadkin
 and 
Catawba
 rivers.
[
45
]
 One path ran north–south and was part of the 
Great Wagon Road
; the second path ran east–west along what is now Trade Street.

Nicknamed the "Queen City",
[
46
]
 like its county a few years earlier, Charlotte was named in honor of 
Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz
, who had become the 
queen consort of Great Britain and Ireland
 in 1761, seven years before the town's incorporation.
[
47
]
 A second nickname derives from the 
American Revolutionary War
, when British commander General 
Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis
 occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents. He wrote that Charlotte was "a hornet's nest of rebellion", leading to the historical nickname "
The Hornet's Nest
".
[
48
]


Within decades of Polk's settling, the area grew to become the Town of Charlotte, 
incorporated
 in 1768.
[
49
]
 Though chartered as Charlotte, the name appears as a form of "Charlottesburgh" on many maps until around 1800.
[
50
]
 A form of "Charlottetown" also appears on maps of British origin depicting General Cornwallis' route of invasion.
[
51
]
 The crossroads in Piedmont became the heart of 
Uptown Charlotte
. In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a 
grid pattern
 for future development. The east–west trading path became Trade Street, and the Great Wagon Road became Tryon Street, in honor of 
William Tryon
, a royal governor of colonial North Carolina.
[
52
]

The 
intersection of Trade and Tryon
 is commonly known today as "Trade and Tryon", or simply "The Square",
[
45
]
 and formally as "Independence Square".
[
53
]


While surveying the boundary between the Carolinas in 1772, 
William Moultrie
 stopped in Charlotte, whose five or six houses were "very ordinary built of logs".
[
54
]


Local leaders came together in 1775 and signed the 
Mecklenburg Resolves
, more popularly known as the 
Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence
. While not a true declaration of independence from 
British
 rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the 
American Revolution
. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as "MecDec", with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina's 
state flag
 and 
state seal
 also bear the date.

Charlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern 
Presbyterianism
, but in the 19th century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, 
Baptist
, 
Methodist
, 
Episcopal
, 
Lutheran
, and 
Roman Catholic
 formed, eventually giving Charlotte the nickname, "
The City of Churches
".
[

In 1799, in nearby Cabarrus County, 12-year-old 
Conrad Reed
 found a 17- pound rock, which his family used as a doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50.
[
56
]
 The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first 
gold rush
. Many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the 
Charlotte Mint
.
[
57
]
 North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States, until the Sierra Nevada was found in 1848,
[
58
]
 although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.



20th century
[
edit
]

Some groups still 
pan for gold
 occasionally in local streams and creeks. The 
Reed Gold Mine
 operated until 1912.
[
59
]
 The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861 when 
Confederate
 forces seized it at the outbreak of the 
Civil War
. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the 
Mint Museum of Art
.

The city's first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from 
Atlanta
 to 
Washington, D.C.
 Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.
[
60
]


Charlotte's city population at the 
1890 census
 grew to 11,557.
[
61
]


In 1910, Charlotte surpassed 
Wilmington
 to become North Carolina's largest city with 34,014 residents.
[
62
]


The population grew again during 
World War I
, when the U.S. government established 
Camp Greene
, north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the 
Piedmont Crescent
. In the 
1920 census
, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, 
Winston-Salem
 with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 
1930 census
, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.
[
63
]


Until 1958, the 
Seaboard Air Line Railroad
 operated a daily passenger train from its 
own station
 (which had opened in 1896) to 
Wilmington
.
[
64
]
[
65
]


The city's modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, largely under the leadership of 
financier
 
Hugh McColl
. McColl transformed 
North Carolina National Bank
 (NCNB) into a formidable national bank that through aggressive acquisitions eventually merged with BankAmerica to become 
Bank of America
. 
First Union
, later 
Wachovia
 in 2001, experienced similar growth before it was acquired by 
San Francisco
–based 
Wells Fargo
 in 2008. Measured by control of assets, Charlotte became the second largest banking headquarters in the United States after 
New York City
.
[
66
]


On September 22, 1989, the city was hit by 
Hurricane Hugo
. With sustained winds of 69 mph (111 km/h) and gusts of 87 mph (140 km/h),
[
67
]
 Hugo caused massive property damage, destroyed 80,000 trees, and knocked out electrical power to most of the population. Residents were without power for weeks, schools were closed for a week or more, and the cleanup took months. The city was caught unprepared; Charlotte is 200 miles (320 km) inland, and residents from coastal areas in both Carolinas often wait out hurricanes in Charlotte.
[
68
]




21st century
[
edit
]


In December 2002, Charlotte and much of central North Carolina were hit by an 
ice storm
 that resulted in more than 1.3 million people losing power.
[
69
]
 During an abnormally cold December, many were without power for weeks. Many of the city's 
Bradford pear
 trees split apart under the weight of the ice.

In August 2015 and September 2016, the city experienced several days of protests related to the 
police shootings
 of 
Jonathan Ferrell
 and 
Keith Scott
.
[
70
]
[
71
]




Geography
[
edit
]


According to the 
United States Census Bureau
, the city has a total area of 312.00 square miles (808.1 km
2
), of which 310.02 square miles (802.9 km
2
) is land and 1.98 square miles (5.1 km
2
) (0.63%) is water.
[

]
 Charlotte is the 
twenty-sixth-most expansive city in the United States
 and lies at an elevation of 751 feet (229 m). Charlotte constitutes most of 
Mecklenburg County
 in the Carolina 
Piedmont
.
[
72
]
 
Uptown Charlotte
 sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek, and was built on the 
gunnies
 of the St. Catherine's and Rudisill 
gold
 
mines
.
[
73
]
 Charlotte is 25 miles (40 km) southwest of 
Concord
;
[
74
]
 26 miles (42 km) northeast of 
Rock Hill, South Carolina
;
[
75
]
 83 miles (134 km) southwest of 
Greensboro
;
[
76
]
 135 miles (217 km) west of 
Fayetteville
;
[
77
]
 and 165 miles (266 km) southwest of 
Raleigh
, the 
state capital
.
[
78
]


Though the Catawba River and its lakes lie several miles west, there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center.
[
79
]
 Consequently, development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size. The lack of these obstructions has contributed to Charlotte's growth as a highway, rail, and air transportation hub.

The urban section of 
Little Sugar Creek Greenway
 was completed in 2012. Inspired in part by the 
San Antonio River Walk
, and integral to Charlotte's extensive urban park system, it is "a huge milestone" according to Gwen Cook, greenway planner for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation.
[
125
]
 However, the Little Sugar Creek Greenway bears no relation to the San Antonio River Walk. The Little Sugar Creek Greenway is prone to flooding during thunderstorms and periods of heavy rain. Creation of Little Sugar Creek Greenway cost $43 million and was controversial because it required the forced acquisition of several established local businesses.
[
126
]


The city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County began purchasing flood-prone homes in the 1990s. Voluntary buyouts of 700 households have created around 200 acres (81 ha)s of open land that can flood safely, thereby saving an estimated $28 million in flood damage and emergency rescues.

Climate
[
edit
]


Like much of the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, Charlotte has a 
humid subtropical climate
 (
Köppen
 
Cfa
), with four distinct seasons. Charlotte is part of USDA 
hardiness zone
 8a, transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south.
[
130
]
 The following narrative reflects 1991–2020 climate data. Winters are short and fairly mild, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 42.1 °F (5.6 °C). On occasion the temperature can fall below 20 °F (−6.7 °C) but Charlotte also enjoys multiple warm winter days in excess of 65 °F (18.3 °C).
[
131
]
 On average, there are 59 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 1.5 days that fail to rise above freezing.
[
131
]


Precipitation is evenly distributed through the year. Only August stands out as a slightly wetter month, averaging 4.35 inches of rainfall. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.1 °F (26.7 °C).
[
132
]
 Hot and humid days can arrive as early as May and last to the end of September. There is an average of 44 days per year with highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C).
[
131
]
 Official record temperatures range from 104 °F (40 °C) recorded six times on 6 September 1954, 9–10 August 2007 and 
June 29 to July 1, 2012
, down to −5 °F (−21 °C) recorded on 
December 30, 1880
, 
February 14, 1899
 and 
January 21, 1985
.
[
133
]
 The record cold daily maximum is 14 °F (−10 °C) on 
February 12 and 13, 1899
.
[
131
]
 The record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on August 13, 1881.
[
a
]
 The average window for freezing temperatures is November 5 to March 30, allowing a growing season of 220 days.
[
131
]


Charlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the 
Gulf of Mexico
 as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny days. Precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring.
[

 On average, Charlotte receives 43.60 inches (1,110 mm) of precipitation annually, evenly distributed throughout the year. Annual precipitation has historically ranged from 26.23 in (666 mm) in 2001 to 68.44 in (1,738 mm) in 1884.

There is an average of 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) of snow, mainly in January and February and rarely December or March, with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain. Seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts in 2011–12 to 22.6 in (57 cm) in 1959–60.
[
131
]
 Snow and ice storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous. Snow has been recorded a small number of times in April, most recently on April 2, 2019.

As of 2020
[update]
, the Charlotte metropolitan area as a whole is noted for having one of the worst 
weather radar
 gaps among any major 
U.S. East Coast city
, with little to no coverage in a roughly quadrilateral area spanning 
Concord
, 
Salisbury
 and much 
of 
Statesville
.
[
136
]
 As the nearest 
NWS
-owned 
NEXRAD
 is located in 
Greer, South Carolina
, more than 80 mi (130 km) to the west-southwest of Charlotte, this deficit is particularly problematic during 
severe thunderstorm
 or 
tornado
 episodes.
[
136
]
 The current lowest angle of the radar, based in Greer, is quite far above the surface over Charlotte, so the 
velocities
 measurement for detecting 
rotations
 cannot be below mid-level in potential tornado-forming storms and thus cannot indicate whether said rotation extends closer to the ground (below 5,000 ft (1,500 m)).

The area is an increasingly growing trucking and freight transportation hub for the East Coast. There are a couple of reasons for this growth.

Zoos and aquariums
[
edit

Charlotte is "... the largest metropolitan area in the United States without a zoo".
[
327
]
 The Charlotte Zoo initiative is a proposal to allocate 250 acres (101 ha) of natural North Carolina land to be dedicated to the zoological foundation, which was incorporated in 2008. On August 18, 2012, Channel 14 News says that the initiative is "... still a few years away" and the plot of land is "... just seven miles from the center of uptown". According to the news channel, "... the zoo will cost roughly $300 million, and will be completely privately-funded."
[
328
]
 The Charlotte Observer references two other zoos, the 
Riverbanks Zoo and Garden
 and the 
North Carolina Zoological Park
 as two "great zoos" that are accessible from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area, both roughly more than 70 miles away.
[
329
]


Charlotte is also served by the 
Sea Life Charlotte-Concord
 Aquarium in the nearby city of 
Concord

Libraries
[

ImaginOn
 Children's Theater and Library


The 
Charlotte Mecklenburg Library
 serves the Charlotte area with a large collection (more than 1.5 million) of books, CDs and DVDs at 15 locations in the city of Charlotte, with branches in the surrounding towns of 
Matthews
, 
Mint Hill
, 
Huntersville
, 
Cornelius
 and 
Davidson
. All locations provide free access to Internet-enabled computers and WiFi, and a library card from one location is accepted at all 20 locations.
[
332
]


Although the library's roots go back to the 
Charlotte Literary and Library Association,
 founded on January 16, 1891,
[
333
]
 the state-chartered 
Carnegie Library
, which opened on the current North Tryon site of the Main Library, was the first non-subscription library opened to members of the public in the city of Charlotte. The philanthropist 
Andrew Carnegie
 donated $25,000 for a library building, on the condition that the city of Charlotte donate a site and $2,500 per year for books and salaries,
[
334
]
 and that the state grant a charter for the library. All conditions were met, and the Charlotte Carnegie Library opened in an imposing classical building on July 2, 1903.

The 1903 state charter also required that a library be opened for the disenfranchised African-American population of Charlotte. This was completed in 1905 with the opening of the 
Brevard Street Library for Negroes
, an independent library in Brooklyn, a historically black area of Charlotte, on the corner of Brevard and East Second Streets (now Martin Luther King Boulevard).
[
335
]
 The Brevard Street Library was the first library for African Americans in the state of North Carolina,
[
335
]
 and some sources say in the southeast.
[
336
]
 The library was closed in 1961 when the Brooklyn neighborhood in Second Ward was redeveloped, but its role as a cultural center for African-Americans in Charlotte is continued by the Beatties Ford and West Boulevard branches of the library system, as well as by Charlotte's African-American Cultural Center.

Government
[
edit
]


Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center


Charlotte has a 
council–manager
 form of government. The 
mayor
 and 
Charlotte City Council
 are elected every two years, with no 
term limits
. The mayor is 
ex officio
 chair of the City Council, and only votes in case of a tie. Unlike other mayors in council–manager systems, Charlotte's mayor has the power to 
veto
 
ordinances
 passed by the council; the council can override a mayoral veto by a vote of seven of its ten members.
[
383
]
 The Council appoints a 
city manager
 to serve as chief administrative officer.
[
384
]


Unlike some other cities and towns in North Carolina, elections are held on a partisan basis. 
Vi Lyles
, a 
Democrat
 
elected in 2017
, became the 59th mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. She was elected to her third term in 2022.
[
385
]


Patrick Cannon
, a Democrat, was sworn in as mayor on December 2, 2013.
[
386
]
 On March 26, 2014, Cannon was arrested on public corruption charges. Later the same day, he resigned as mayor.
[
387
]
 Mayor Pro Tem 
Michael Barnes
 served as Acting Mayor until April 7, when the City Council selected State Senator 
Dan Clodfelter
, also a Democrat, to serve the remainder of Cannon's term.
[
388
]
 Former Mecklenburg County Commission chairwoman 
Jennifer Roberts
 defeated Clodfelter in the 2015 Democratic primary and went on to win the general election, becoming the first Democratic woman to be elected to the post.
[
389
]
 She was ousted in the 2017 Democratic primary by Mayor Pro Tem 
Vi Lyles
, who later defeated Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith in the general election to become Mayor of Charlotte.
[
390
]


Historically, voters have been friendly to moderates of both parties. However, in recent years, Charlotte has swung heavily to the Democrats. Republican strength is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the city, while Democratic strength is concentrated in the south-central, eastern, and northern areas.
[
391
]
 The city had a Republican mayor from 1987 to 2009.
[
392
]
[
393
]
[
394
]


The Charlotte City Council has 11 members (7 from districts and 4 
at-large
). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all 4 of the at-large seats in the November 2013, 2015, and 2017 municipal elections. While the City Council is responsible for passing ordinances, the city's budget, and other policies, all decisions can be overridden by the 
North Carolina General Assembly
, since North Carolina municipalities do not have 
home rule
. While municipal powers have been broadly construed since the 1960s, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local matters.
[
395

Charlotte is split between two 
congressional districts
 on the federal level. The northern half of the city is in the
