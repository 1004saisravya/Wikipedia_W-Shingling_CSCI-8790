Cumberland
 is an 
edge city
 in 
Cobb County
 located in an 
unincorporated area
 of the northwest 
Atlanta metropolitan area
, Georgia, United States. It is situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of 
Downtown Atlanta
. With approximately 122,000 workers and 103,000 residents, Cumberland is the region's fifth-largest business district, and is marked by several modern 
skyscrapers
 rising from the wooded hills above the freeways. The 
Atlanta Braves
 of  
Major League Baseball
 (MLB) play their games at 
Truist Park
, which is located in Cumberland.





History
[
edit
]


Cobb Energy Centre


Cumberland has changed immensely over the past 50 years. From 1927 to 1960, the area contained 
Camp Bert Adams
, a 
Boy Scout
 reservation which still has a road bearing its name in the Vinings vicinity (the camp moved in 1960 to a site south of 
Covington
). The area began seeing growth following 
World War II
, but major development did not occur until 
Cumberland Mall
 opened as Georgia's largest and metro Atlanta's sixth enclosed regional mall in 1973. A decade later, the first office tower of 
Cobb Galleria
 was built on 86 acres (350,000 m
2
) of prime space in what became the heart of the Cumberland district. This paved the way for several other towers, 
retail strips
 and 
hotels
. In 1988, property owners formed the Cumberland Community Improvement District (Cumberland CID), the first in Georgia.

The CID, a 
self-taxing district
, has raised millions and has completed several 
infrastructure
 improvements in the area since its inception.

 During the summer of 1994, the Cobb-Marietta Exhibit Hall and Coliseum Authority built the $48 million Cobb Galleria Centre by renovating the existing mall there, and it has become another success for the district. A few small shopping centers were constructed in the mid-1990s, and a Cumberland Mall expansion and renovation was completed in 2006. Construction was completed on the 
Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre
 in late 2007, adding 
nightlife
 to the area. The 
Atlanta Opera
, founded in 1979, moved its base to this location.



Geography
[
edit
]


It is situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of 
downtown Atlanta
 at the junction of 
I-75
 and 
I-285
 (the "Cobb Cloverleaf") in 
Cobb County
. Although small portions lie within incorporated 
Smyrna
, the majority of the area is unincorporated and shares 
ZIP code
 30339 with the 
Vinings
 area, which the 
United States Postal Service
 assigns as an Atlanta mailing address, although "Vinings" is acceptable as an alternate. While there are no official boundaries (except for the CID, which is a 5½-square-mile area that includes the interchanges of I-75 (Exit#s 258,9,60) and I-285 (Exit#s 19,20), and U.S. Highway 41

), the 
business district
 generally extends as far northeast as the Wildwood Office Park on Powers Ferry Road, and up 
Cobb Parkway
, the district's 
main street
. Windy Hill Road is generally the northern extent of the district. To the south and west, it extends down 
Cumberland Parkway
 and 
Paces Ferry Road
.
