Geography

It is situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of 
downtown Atlanta
 at the junction of 
I-75
 and 
I-285
 (the "Cobb Cloverleaf") in 
Cobb County
. Although small portions lie within incorporated 
Smyrna
, the majority of the area is unincorporated and shares 
ZIP code
 30339 with the 
Vinings
 area, which the 
United States Postal Service
 considers to be unincorporated Atlanta. While there are no official boundaries (except for the CID, which is a 5½-square-mile area that includes the interchange of I-75, I-285 and U.S. Highway 41
[

]
), the 
business district
 generally extends as far northeast as the Wildwood Office Park on Powers Ferry Road, and up 
Cobb Parkway
, the district's 
main street
. Windy Hill Road is generally the northern extent of the district. To the south and west, it extends down 
Cumberland Parkway
 and 
Paces Ferry Road
.



History
[

Cobb Energy Centre


Cumberland has changed immensely over the past 50 years. From 1927 to 1960, the area contained 
Camp Bert Adams
, a 
Boy Scout
 reservation which still has a road bearing its name in the Vinings vicinity (the camp moved in 1960 to a site south of 
Covington
). The area began seeing growth following 
World War II
, but major development didn't occur until Cumberland Mall opened as Georgia's largest and metro Atlanta's sixth enclosed regional mall in 1973. A decade later, the first office tower of the Galleria was built on 86 acres (350,000 m
2
) of prime space in what became the heart of the Cumberland district. This paved the way for several other towers, 
retail strips
 and 
hotels
.  In 1988, property owners formed the 
Cumberland Community Improvement District
 (Cumberland CID), the first in Georgia.

 The CID, a 
self-taxing district
, has raised millions and has completed several 
infrastructure
 improvements in the area since its inception.

 During the summer of 1994, the Cobb-Marietta Exhibit Hall and Coliseum Authority built the $48 million 
Cobb Galleria
 Centre by renovating the existing mall there, and it has become another success for the district. A few small shopping centers were constructed in the mid-1990s, and a 
Cumberland Mall
 expansion and renovation was completed in 2006. Construction was completed on the 
Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre
 in late 2007, adding 
nightlife
 to the area. The 
Atlanta Opera
, founded in 1979, moved its base to this location.



Transportation
[
edit
]


The dominant form of transportation in Cumberland, as with most suburban edge cities, is the automobile, which is transported along a network of collector roads. Cumberland Boulevard encircles most of the area, and then continues northeast to Wildwood as Windy Ridge Parkway after crossing US Highway 41. Windy Ridge runs through the Interstate North office park, located immediately to the north of the interchange, and home to the Weather Channel. Interstate North Parkway runs parallel to 75 southeast to 285, then parallels it (and Powers Ferry) across the 
Chattahoochee River
. Akers Mill Road starts in the east at Powers Ferry, is broken by a stretch of Cumberland Boulevard, then continues west across 41. Circle 75 Parkway begins at Windy Hill Road, opposite the I-75 southbound off-ramp, and parallels the road until turning southwest along I-285, becoming Spring Road at 41 (and then Concord Road at Atlanta Road in Smyrna). 
CobbLinc
 , Marietta/Cobb County's Transit System serves the District in addition to one  
Marta bus
 line making connections at the Cumberland/Galleria Transfer station. The former Louisville & Nashville (Now CSXT) mainline from Cincinnati to Atlanta, runs just west of Truist Park.

Cumberland's office towers house some of the area's 24 million square feet (over 2.2 million square meters) of office space, containing more office space than 
downtown Miami
 and making it 
metro Atlanta
's fifth-largest commercial office district, after 
Downtown
, 
Midtown
, 
Buckhead
, and 
Perimeter Center
. Companies such as 
Travelport
, 
The Home Depot
, Genuine Parts Company, and 
The Weather Channel
 are headquartered in the area.  Cumberland also houses some ten million square feet (930,000m²) of retail, with its focal point being 
Cumberland Mall
.

In 2017, the 
Atlanta Braves
 opened 
Truist Park
 and The Battery Atlanta, a mixed-use development surrounding the ballpark, at the west-northwest side of the interchange of I-75 and I-285, just north of the Galleria, with a pedestrian bridge connecting to the Galleria.
