Cumberland
 is a neighborhood and 
edge city
 in 
metro Atlanta
, Georgia, United States. with approximately 122,000 workers and 103,000 residents. It is a major hub for business, convention, and retail in the region. Cumberland is situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of 
downtown Atlanta
 at the junction of 
I-75
 and 
I-285
 (the "
Cobb Cloverleaf
") in 
Cobb County
. The area is marked by several modern 
skyscrapers
 rising from the wooded hills above the freeways. These towers house some of the area's 24 million square feet (over 2.2 million square meters) of office space, containing more office space than 
downtown Miami
 and making it 
metro Atlanta
's fifth-largest commercial office district, after Downtown, 
Midtown
, 
Buckhead
, and 
Perimeter Center
. Heavyweights such as 
The Home Depot
, and 
The Weather Channel
 are headquartered in Cumberland. It also houses some ten million square feet (930,000m²) of retail, with its focal point being the newly-renovated 
Cumberland Mall
. Although small portions of Cumberland lie within 
Smyrna
 and 
Vinings
, the majority of the area remains unincorporated with an Atlanta address.

History
[
edit
]


Cumberland has changed immensely over the past 50 years. In 1960, the area contained Camp Bert Adams, a 
Boy Scout
 reservation which still has a road bearing its name in the Vinings vicinity. Cumberland began most of its growth following 
World War II
, but went into overdrive when Cumberland Mall opened as Georgia's largest mall and metro Atlanta's sixth enclosed, regional mall in 1973. A decade later, the first office tower of the Galleria was built on 86 acres (350,000 m
2
) of prime space in what became the heart of the Cumberland district. This paved the way for several other towers, 
retail strips
 and 
hotels
. In 1988 property owners formed the 
Cumberland Community Improvement District
 (Cumberland CID), the first in Georgia.

 The CID, a 
self-taxing district
, has raised millions and has completed several 
infrastructure
 improvements in the area since its inception.

 During the summer of 1994, the Cobb-Marietta Exhibit Hall and Coliseum Authority built the $48 million 
Cobb Galleria
 Centre by renovating the existing mall there, and it has become another success for the district.

A few small shopping centers were constructed in the mid-1990s, and a 
Cumberland Mall
 expansion and renovation was completed in 2006. Construction was completed on the 
Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre
 in late 2007, adding 
nightlife
 to the area. The Atlanta Opera, founded in 1979, has moved its base to this location.

Riverwood 200 rendering


There are many private projects in progress and/or proposed, including:



Riverwood 200: At the corner of Cumberland Blvd and Cobb Parkway. 360 residential units and also a large amount of office and retail space including a 16 story office tower as an extension of the already existing Riverwood 100 complex. The project is led by Seven Oaks Company LLC and GE Asset Management. Architect is HOK. Update: Framing completed on Riverwood's apartment and the new parking garage is already completed.


Park Vinings: Originally planned to be 110 $1 million + condo units, recent zoning submissions indicates that the change in the housing market and the currently saturated condo market in Atlanta has resulted in plans being changed for this property to house a 33 story retirement community with increased density than the original plans.

Geography
[
edit
]


While there are no official boundaries (except for the CID, which is a 5 ½-square-mile area that includes the intersections of I-75, I-285 and U.S. Highway 41
[
5
]
), the 
business district
 generally extends as far northeast as the Wildwood Office Park on Powers Ferry Road, and up 
Cobb Parkway
, the district's 
main street
.  Windy Hill Road is generally the northern extent of the district, except possibly for Terrell Mill Road.  To the south and west, it extends down 
Cumberland Parkway
 and 
Paces Ferry
 roads.

Cumberland Boulevard encircles most of the area, and then continues northeast to Wildwood as Windy Ridge Parkway after crossing 41.  Windy Ridge runs through the Interstate North office park, located immediately to the north of the interchange, and home to the Weather Channel.  Interstate North Parkway runs parallel to 75 southeast to 285, then parallels it (and Powers Ferry) across the 
Chattahoochee River
.  Akers Mill Road starts in the east at Powers Ferry, is broken by a stretch of Cumberland Boulevard, then continues west across 41.  Circle 75 Parkway begins at Windy Hill Road, opposite the I-75 southbound off-ramp, and parallels the road until turning southwest along I-285, becoming Spring Road at 41 (and then Concord Road at Atlanta Road in Smyrna).

The Cumberland district also borders the West Paces Ferry district of 
Buckhead
 in 
Atlanta
 and a portion of 
Sandy Springs
, separated by the 
Chattahoochee River
.

Notably, one of metro Atlanta's worst 
tornadoes
 made its first touchdown in the area, at Windy Hill Road and Cobb Parkway in April 1998.  The 
Dunwoody tornado
, as it came to be known for its major damage in 
Dunwoody
, was captured on police video and later shown around the world as the two 
Cobb County Police
 officers drove southbound on 41 right through it, in order to escape the nighttime surprise.

Just a few miles or several kilometers east on 
the Perimeter
 at 
Georgia 400
 and the boundary between Dunwoody and Sandy Springs is 
Perimeter Center
, another similar edge city also created as a result of the 
Interstate Highway System
 and 
GDOT
's choice of highway location in the 1960s.  The Cumberland 
skyline
 can be easily seen in front of Atlanta's by looking southeast from atop 
Kennesaw Mountain
.
