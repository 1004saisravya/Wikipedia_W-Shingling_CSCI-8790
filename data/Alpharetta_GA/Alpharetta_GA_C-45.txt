History
[
edit
]


In the 1830s, the 
Cherokee
 people in Georgia and elsewhere in 
the South
 were 
forcibly relocated
 to the 
Indian Territory
 (present-day 
Oklahoma
) under the 
Indian Removal Act
. 
Pioneers
 and 
farmers
 later settled on the newly vacated land, situated along a former Cherokee trail stretching from the 
North Georgia mountains
 to the 
Chattahoochee River
.
[

]


One of the area's first permanent landmarks was the New Prospect Camp Ground (also known as the 
Methodist
 Camp Ground), beside a 
natural spring
 near what is now downtown Alpharetta.
[
6
]
 It later served as a 
trading post
 for the exchanging of goods among settlers.
[
6
]


Known as the town of Milton through July 1858, the city of Alpharetta was 
chartered
 on December 11, 1858, with boundaries extending in a 0.5-mile (0.8 km) radius from the city courthouse.
[
6
]
 It served as the 
county seat
 of 
Milton County
 until 1931, when Milton County merged with Fulton County to avoid bankruptcy during the 
Great Depression
.
[
6
]


The city's name may be a variation of a fictional Indian girl, Alfarata, in the 19th-century song "
The Blue Juniata
"; it may also be derived from 
alpha
, the first letter of the Greek alphabet.
[
7
]


The 
Simeon and Jane Rucker Log House
, built in 1833, was listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places
 in 1997.
