The former Fairfax County Courthouse is the oldest historic building in Fairfax.

The reason the courthouse was moved from the Tysons Corner location was because of "Indian hostilities", as noted on the stone marker at the northwest corner of Gallows Road and [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]].  The courthouse operated there until 1790, when Virginia ceded the land where the courthouse was located for the creation of Washington, DC. The General Assembly specified that the new courthouse should be located in the center of the county, and was established at the corner of what was Old [[Little River Turnpike]] and is now Main Street and what was Ox Road and is now [[Chain Bridge Road]] on land donated by town founder Richard Ratcliffe.<ref>[http://www.historicfairfax.org/HFCI31.pdf HFCI31.pmd] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128034727/http://www.historicfairfax.org/HFCI31.pdf |date=November 28, 2007 }}.

According to the magazine, "These factors are increasingly important in a recession. When businesses and jobs retract, as they have nationwide, municipalities with strong environments for start-ups, and those that offer attractive amenities, are better suited to recover from economic downtimes, as there are more business activity filling the void."

As an independent city of Virginia rather than an incorporated town within a county, Fairfax derives its governing authority from the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1966.<ref name="charter">{{cite web|title=Fairfax, City of|url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/charters/fairfax/|website=Legislative Information System|publisher=Commonwealth of Virginia|access-date=March 27, 2017}}</ref> An [[exclave]] of Fairfax County is located within Fairfax.<ref name="Fairfaxcitymap" /><ref name="Courtadd" />

===Mayor arrested for distribution of methamphetamine===
On August 4, 2016, then-Mayor Scott Silverthorne was arrested in a sting operation conducted by the Fairfax County Police Department. After receiving a tip that he was involved in drugs-related activities online, a police detective engaged Silverthorne on an online website "...used to arrange for casual sexual encounters between men."<ref name="FCPD">{{cite web|title=Three Arrested for Distribution of Methamphetamine|url=https://fcpdnews.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/three-arrested-for-distribution-of-methamphetamine/|website=Fairfax County Police Department Public Affairs Bureau|date=August 5, 2016 |publisher=Fairfax County Police Department|access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> The detective then arranged a meeting with Silverthorne and two other men, in which they agreed to exchange methamphetamine. At the meeting in [[Tyson's Corner, Virginia]], detectives performed the exchange and then arrested Silverthorne along with the two other men. He was charged with felony distribution of methamphetamine and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia.<ref name="FCPD"/> He announced his resignation on Monday, August 8, 2016, in a letter to the City Council.<ref name="WaPo Story Silverthorne">{{cite news|last1=Olivo|first1=Antonio|title=Fairfax Mayor Scott Silverthorne to resign after sex-for-drugs arrest|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/fairfax-mayor-scott-silverthorne-to-resign-after-sex-for-drugs-arrest/2016/08/08/bd68772c-5d78-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html|access-date=October 19, 2016|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 8, 2016}}</ref>
